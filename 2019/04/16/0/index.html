<p>Give me 10 minutes and I’ll show you the 5 phases of acquiring the perfect American English accent (via a conversation about POTTY TRAINING!)</p>
<p>You’re learning a lot about American English pronunciation. How Americans talk and how to sound American. And as you’ve learned, you’ve started to become aware of all of your English habits that you’d like to change. You start to become incredibly frustrated. It feels impossible to take what you’re learning about pronunciation and apply it to actual real conversations that you’re having. In this video, we’re going to talk about the process that takes you from knowing something to being able to do it regularly without even having to think about it. </p>
<p>As i’ve been raising my son who’s two, I have noticed lots of little things that made me think about teaching my adult students and accent training. One of the things that’s so different about pronunciation training is that it’s different for most of the learning we do as adults. When you were learning English, you were likely learning it as knowledge for the mind, which is what almost all of the learning we do as older children and adults is, at least here in the US.</p>
<p>We’re learning things to know, like memorizing vocabulary or English verb conjugations. Things that you can write and talk about. Training in a sport or on a musical instrument or singing is a lot more like working on your accent than studying English is. Some people think I’m an English teacher. I correct them.</p>
<p>I’m not. That’s not how I think about myself at all. I’m primarily an accent trainer. I try to figure out how to help students understand and change their habits to be more comfortable and confident speaking English. A while ago, I was reading a book about raising kids that really reminded me of the different phases of learning when working on your accent. I talked through this same sequence all the time with my adult students. And you know what the book was about? It was about potty training. That’s right.</p>
<p>This is where Stoney was learning something totally new about his body and I had to try to understand his experience, to help guide him through it. The book said this: the first phase is diapers. From newborn until it starts to become something that he notices or we start talking about. Think of a newborn. Total unawareness about something like peeing. This is phase one. As he moves out of diapers he has to start noticing something about his body that he hadn’t</p>
<p>Paid attention to before. This is phase two. This isn’t just like my adult students working on their accent and being easily understood when speaking.</p>
<p>You’re starting to notice something about your body, the way that you sound, that you hadn’t necessarily paid attention to before or even known how to pay attention to.</p>
<p>The book talked about how first, Stoney will notice after he’s peed. He’ll be able to say: I peed. Of course that’s disappointing if your goal is not to have your kid pee his pants. But it’s a necessary step in this process. This is not a habit yet. He’s still understanding what’s happening. This is phase two. He no longer has total unawareness, he now has awareness when something has happened. Phase three is being able to tell me when he’s peeing as it’s actually happening. So phase two is past.</p>
<p>You notice it after it happens. Phase three is present. You notice it as you do it. Phase four, you may have been able to guess, is future. You think about it just before it happens. This is the phase he’s in now, thankfully, where he can say: I’m going to pee, or I need to pee. That’s a lot easier to deal with than: I peed or I’m peeing. And there’s a fifth phase.</p>
<p>That’s the phase where he doesn’t tell us anymore. It’s just part of normal life and he goes to the bathroom when he needs to. Let’s talk about these phases with changing a pronunciation habit.</p>
<p>Phase 1, total unawareness. You’ve never known about the sounds of American English or what you were doing wrong.</p>
<p>You’ve learned English but you’ve never specifically studied pronunciation. So when you first start studying, you learn all kinds of new things, like exactly how the AH vowel sounds that it’s not in your language and how it’s made.</p>
<p>That’s something you learn with the mind and that’s very satisfying. You could describe it and teach it to someone else. As I said, this is the kind of learning most of us do as adults. It’s moving from phase 1 to phase 2, total unawareness to understanding. But there are still three more transitions to make before making something a habit and this is where many of my students get frustrated. They’re stuck in Phase two, and that is you know you’re doing it wrong because you learned about it, you notice it, but you notice you’re still constantly doing it wrong in conversation.</p>
<p>You can’t think of what to say and pronunciation at the same time. You’re stuck in Phase two. The past phase. You notice it after you’ve already made a mistake. That can be very frustrating.</p>
<p>This is where some people want to give up. It’s their habit and they don’t see how they can ever change it. How can they ever think of two things at once? But you can get all the way to phase five. I always try to tell my students this is actually progress. You’ve gone from not knowing something at all to knowing it.</p>
<p>Don’t give up so early in the journey. For example, let’s say you’re working on getting the UH as in butter vowel to sound really natural and American. This one can be tough because it depends a lot on placement too. You’ve learned how it’s made and how it’s different from other sounds, you’ve listened to a lot of minimal pairs and now you can hear it as its own sound. You left phase one for phase two.</p>
<p>You have awareness. And you can practice it over and over. But when you’re in conversation, thinking about what to say, you find you still say it wrong. You notice it after it comes out of your mouth, and this feels really disappointing to you. This is where some students want to quit.</p>
<p>You’ve started training the sound, doing the repetitions to retrain your muscles. How do you bridge your practice time to real speaking in real conversation? It’s actually simple. Just more training. By noticing what you’re doing wrong, you can focus on your practice more. If there are any words that consistently don’t feel right, write them down. Make sure that’s one of the words that you’re training ten, twenty, or more times a day. You just need more repetitions of doing it right to change the habit. A great tool can be to record yourself.</p>
<p>Many people now have phones that can record audio. Record a conversation you have at some point during the day. Listen to it later. Now that you’ve increased your knowledge, you’ll be able to be your own teacher. You’ll be able to notice things that aren’t right, and you can write them down, and work with them over and over. This is great if there are certain words you’re using a lot for work or your daily life.</p>
<p>Take the words or phrases that intimidate you the most and practice them 20 or more times, several times throughout the day. This repetition is necessary but it will only take a few minutes. Practice it slowly and at regular pace. Imitate a native speaker by going to Forvo.com or Youglish.com to hear many samples.</p>
<p>This is how you bridge the gap between practicing and real conversation. It’s simply more focused practice on the actual words that you’ll use in your daily life. And as you train more and more, you’ll go through the same phases that Stoney went through for potty training. You’ll go from noticing your mistake after you’ve made it, phase 2, to phase 3 where as you start to stay the word, your brain gets triggered and you remember how you want to try to say it. Don’t be afraid to repeat your word with a better pronunciation.</p>
<p>As you do more training, you’ll be able to think about the right pronunciation just as your brain has come up with the word and you want to say it. And with more training and more time, you’ll no longer even think about it. Your confidence on a particular word or sound will be that high. You won’t need to think about it, you won’t notice it, it’s no longer a problem for you. So it can be very frustrating, because the first thing that happens after you learn something is realizing how often you do it wrong, and how hard it is to change a habit. That’s true. And the more you learn about pronunciation the more habits you’ll want to change but you can change them.</p>
<p>And don’t let the work that is necessary turn you off. You can do it. I’ve seen hundreds of students change their habit through regular training, repetition. A little hard work and the payoff is so big. If you get frustrated at the beginning, you’ll never move on to the next phase. But if you take it as a tool for learning, and you keep training, you will get there. You’ll get to where you want to be. What are some of your best tips for how you’ve worked on your accent and made a real change? Or for how you’ve stayed motivated? Maybe there’s a particular word that you couldn’t say correctly that you now say without effort.</p>
<p>Share the tips or tricks that you use in practicing and improving in the comments below. What is one major victory you’ve had while studying English? Share these things in the comments below so everyone can learn from you and feel motivated by you and your successes. And don’t forget, keep working. You can’t change a habit overnight, it does take some time and dedication, but it’s worth it, and you can do it. I believe in you.</p>
<p>That’s it and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

<p>Learn about two different ways of speaking English:  one is more horizontal, where you pull your lips wide, and one is more vertical, where you drop your jaw.  Which one sounds more natural?  Find out in this video.</p>
<p>Study with Rachel’s online courses in the Rachel’s English Academy.  Supercharge your conversation skills!  </p>
<p>Hi! I’m Tom Kelley, a Rachel’s English teacher. And I’m here to tell you to relax! Chances are you can. It’s really helpful when you’re speaking English. Today’s practice tip is about thinking “vertically” rather than “horizontally” when you speak – you’ll see what I mean in a second.</p>
<p>A lot of my students are amazed to discover that speaking English can actually take less effort than they are currently using. Today I’m going to talk about one area of the face in which I see a lot of effort being used – the lips. Some students tend to pull their lips back wide when speaking – I call this speaking horizontally. I’m going to do it for a second. It’s like a bit of a smile on my face. And it tends to limit how much I drop my jaw. It also changes the way I sound. It takes my vocal placement from a lower resonance, to a higher resonance. We want to keep that low, open chest resonance when speaking English.</p>
<p>There are a few sounds in English that might require a little bit of horizontal stretch from the lips. For instance, the EE as in ME vowel. Many students like to pull the lips back for this vowel sound. EE. EE. That’s fine. And you will achieve a clear EE vowel when you do that. But when you watch native speakers use words with the EE vowel – you’ll notice that if the lip corners pull back, it’s a very subtle movement. For example, ‘easy’. ‘Easy’. My lip corners are barely pulling wide. Most of the EE vowel is made with the middle of my tongue arching up in the mouth.</p>
<p>Another vowel sound that might use a little bit of lip movement is the AA as in Hat vowel. Many students will say “hat”, using a lot of lip tension. This tension can actually make your voice sound a little nasal. The vocal placement rises into the face and nasal passages. Hat. My hat is missing. Instead, let the lips stay a bit more relaxed and let the tongue position be more important. For this vowel the tongue is wide and arching slightly up and forward in the mouth. Hat. My hat is missing. Now the vocal placement sounds the same the whole way through the sentence. Only with relaxation can you find that chest resonance.</p>
<p>I really encourage you to use a mirror to check and see if this is something you do. If you find that you tend to pull the lips corners back a lot when you speak, see what happens if you speak “vertically”, rather than horizontally. This means relaxing the lips and letting the jaw drop down a bit more for stressed syllables.</p>
<p>Let’s run through some examples:</p>
<p>Bed. Speaking horizontally: bed. Speaking vertically: bed. It takes so much less effort to speak vertically.</p>
<p>Same. Horizontal: same. Vertical: same.</p>
<p>To do this, you may need to move your tongue more than you are used to. If you’ve been using lip and jaw tension for the AY diphthong, for example, chances are you are pulling your lips wide. Instead, just arch the middle of the tongue from a low, wide position in the mouth to a higher position. AY. AY. And let the lips relax. American English depends on a lot of flexible movement from the tongue so that the lips and jaw can stay relaxed.</p>
<p>How about a couple practice sentences:<br>I love vacation days. Avoid the horizontal: vacation days. And go vertical and relaxed. Vacation days. I love vacation days.</p>
<p>Take the empty chair in the back. Horizontal: Take the empty chair in the back. Vertical: Take the empty chair in the back. Again, hopefully you can hear how relaxing my lips and jaw ends up changing the placement of my voice and the sound of my vowels and diphthongs.</p>
<p>Use a mirror when you practice to see if you are speaking horizontally. If you are, cool! Now you know you get to relax. And it’s always great to remember that you’re allowed to relax.</p>

<p>Learn tips and tricks to increase your vocabulary.  First learn how to pick up new words, then learn tips for memorization.  Always study the pronunciation and practice words out loud!</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to over how to increase your vocabulary.</p>
<p>One of the challenges in learning a foreign language is remembering all of the new vocabulary. In this video, we’re going to go over a few tips for learning new words, and for remembering them.</p>
<p>First, expose yourself to the language. For example, read. I still learn English words from reading. I find that every couple of months the New York Times uses a word that either I’ve never heard before, or that I’ve heard but I’m not totally solid on the meaning. So I look it up, learn the meaning, and then go back to the sentence and solidify it. One good idea is to think of another word that you know that you could replace it with in that sentence. A word that wouldn’t change the meaning. Then say the sentence with that word. Tying the new word to a word you already know, and studying it in the context of the sentence will help you remember it.</p>
<p>If you know my channel, you know it’s a pronunciation channel. Always learn the pronunciation when you learn a new word. When you look up a word in the dictionary, the pronunciation is always right there. Many online dictionaries also play an audio file so you can hear a native speaker say the word. Practice it out loud several times.</p>
<p>You want to read at the right level to learn. If it’s too easy, you won’t learn many new vocabulary words. If it’s too hard, you don’t really get the context because there’s too much that you don’t know. Try reading at a level where you look up, at most, one word per sentence.</p>
<p>As you discover new words in your reading, write them down, along with the meaning and the context. You can either use a notebook, or flashcards if you prefer that. Make a system that works for you so you know you’re going to actually go back and study the words again. Most words you won’t remember from just looking it up once.</p>
<p>When you look the word up, look for related words or other forms of the word. For example, let’s say you’re learning the word ‘adjust’, which is a verb. You may find in the dictionary that ‘adjustable’ is an adjective and ‘adjustment’ is a noun. Write these down too.</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to look for one antonym or one synonym. An antonym is a word with an opposite meaning, and a synonym is a word with the same or similar meaning. So, let’s say you’re learning the word ‘blurry’. A synonym would be ‘fuzzy’. An antonym would be ‘clear’. If any of these words are unknown to you, write them down too. You can find synonyms and antonyms by looking in a thesaurus, like thesaurus.com.</p>
<p>Another great way to learn vocabulary is to watch TV, movies, and online videos. But you can’t just sit back, relax, and be entertained. You can do that sometimes, you’re going to learn more if you actively participate in learning. When I was in Germany, I watched a lot of TV with my notebook in hand. When I heard a word or phrase that I knew I could identify but didn’t know the meaning of, I immediately stopped paying attention to the television, or paused what I was watching, and wrote down the word. Then I looked up the meaning and wrote down the context. It was so easy to remember new words I picked up this way because I had the visual of what I had been seeing, I had the visual of the word written down, and I practiced out loud several times. The context of the situation helped solidify that word or phrase. If you can rewind and watch again, do this, and pay attention to the pronunciation. Imitate the pronunciation out loud 5 or 6 times. Make sure you write the pronunciation down, either using IPA or another system that works for you.</p>
<p>This is also great for learning phrases or sequences of words that are frequently used. When I was in Germany watching a drama, I heard the phrase: Es tut mir furchtbar leid. I had never heard this phrase before. I knew ‘es tut mir leid’, which means “I’m sorry”, so I recognized the phrase, and I learned a new way to intensify it with ‘furchtbar’. I’m terribly sorry.</p>
<p>When you learn a new phrase, write it down. Ok, so what do you do with all of these words and phrases you’re writing down? By learning them in the context of reading or video, you’re already helping yourself memorize them. But you’re still going to have to put in some work.</p>
<p>Try to memorize, really solidly memorize, 3-5 words a day. If you have a great memory, then maybe go for 10. But limit yourself to that.</p>
<p>Tip 1 for memorization: The Laura tip. I’m naming this after my friend who was studying Spanish abroad. Laura would write down and learn four or five new words that she heard in conversation throughout the day. At the end of the day, she would turn them into a song. This might involve gestures or movements to help her understand. It might contain just the word, if the gesture was clear, or the word and definition, or the word in a sentence. Adding music, adding a melody, really helps your brain hold onto information. She taught me one of her songs and I still remember it, 8 years later. And I wasn’t even trying to study Spanish at the time. Let’s come up with an example song. Let’s say you’re learning the words sprint, deceive, increase, and concern. Your song could go something like this:</p>
<p>Sprint! Don’t deceive me. Increase. I care because I’m concerned.</p>
<p>Don’t spend much time on it. It should be short and fun. Sing it 10 or 12 times. Then sing the one from yesterday a few times. Adding motion and melody will help you memorize. It doesn’t matter at all what the melody is, or even if you’re musical. It will still help you remember.</p>
<p>Tip 2 for memorization: Repetition and grouping.</p>
<p>Go over your vocabulary words many times. Practice them out loud. Repetition is extremely important. If it’s a tough word to pronounce, slow it down, don’t rush: immediately [4x]. Put the words in groups and drill the groups together. Then group them differently and drill again. For example, if you wrote down 10 words or phrases while watching one episode of the Sopranos, practice those words together and think about the episode and the context for each word. Or, group them by vowel sound in the stressed syllable, for example, furniture, unearth, burley, return, jury, blurt, curse. These words all had the UR vowel in the stressed syllable. Or, organize your words by stress: typical, period, numerous, everything, difficult, curious, DA-da-da. These were all three-syllable words with stress on the first syllable. Or, organize the words by meaning, grouping together words of similar meaning. Or group them by how well you know them, putting words you know really well in one group, words you kind of know in a second group, and words you need a lot of help with in a third group. Creating various groups will help you memorize, and will make drilling vocabulary more engaging.</p>
<p>Tip 3: Visualization. When you learn a word, come up with a picture for it, a mini-story in one picture in your mind that makes sense to you. This is a common mnemonic device, and you probably used it when learning vocabulary in your own language.</p>
<p>So, absorb as much of the language as you can through reading and watching video, or even writing down words from conversation around you. Organize these words in a system that works for you: maybe a notebook, maybe flashcards. And get creative when memorizing. The more often you come back and study your vocabulary words, the more you’ll be able to remember them and to use them yourself in writing and conversation.</p>

<h2 id="Ending-Voiced-vs-Unvoiced-Consonants"><a href="#Ending-Voiced-vs-Unvoiced-Consonants" class="headerlink" title="Ending Voiced vs. Unvoiced Consonants"></a>Ending Voiced vs. Unvoiced Consonants</h2><p>Tagged With: <a href="https://rachelsenglish.com/tag/comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comparison</a></p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how the ending Z sound in words like ‘flowers’ [flaˈʊ əɹz] sounds more like an S? Learn how to lighten certain endings to pronounce them easily and naturally.</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to talk about ending voiced vs. unvoiced consonants.</p>
<p>In American English, we have voiced and unvoiced sounds. All vowels are voiced. All diphthongs are voiced. Consonants can be either voiced or unvoiced. Unvoiced consonants are made just with air, no, uhh, sound from the vocal cords. For example, hh, sh, tt, pp. Voiced consonants do have voice in them, uhh, like: mm, bb, zh.</p>
<p>Hh, sh, tt, pp.<br>Mm, bb, zh.</p>
<p>There are lots of consonant pairs where the mouth position is the same, and one is voiced, the other is unvoiced, for example, CH / JJ.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, I’ll get a comment on a video asking about the pronunciation of these paired consonants at the end of a word. These come from people with a good ear that pay attention to what they hear. Mostly they say, I don’t hear a voiced consonant, I hear an unvoiced consonant. They’re right. We’re going to get into a topic here that is quite advanced. It deals with subtle differences of sound.</p>
<p>Let’s take, for example, the word ‘flowers’. In IPA, we spell that like this: the ending consonant is the Z sound, which is voiced. But actually, that kind of sounds like an S at the end, doesn’t it? Flowers, ss, ss. A really weak, light S. It doesn’t have a strong S, flowersss. That’s not correct. But it also doesn’t have a strong Z, flowerzzz. Flowers, ss, ss. It actually has a very weak S.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I was reading an old pronunciation book and it said how in these voiced/unvoiced pairs, the unvoiced is strong and the voiced is weak. I didn’t really know what that meant until I started thinking about ending consonants. These ending consonants are so weak that we take the voice out of them, and they end up sounding like weak unvoiced sounds. So the word is not flowerssss or flowerzzz but flowers, ss, ss, a weak unvoiced consonant.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a few more words.</p>
<p>Dive, ff, ff. It’s really a very weak F [f]. It’s not divvve or difffe, but dive, ff, ff.</p>
<p>Garage, sh, sh, sh. It’s a very weak unvoiced SH sound. It’s not garasshh or garazzhh, but, garage, sh, sh, sh.</p>
<p>Badge, ch, ch, ch. Very weak, unvoiced sound. Not batch, or baDGE, but badge, ch.</p>
<p>Weakening these ending voiced consonants can help you say the words more easily and more naturally.</p>
<p>Let’s study the word ‘badge’ a little further, and compare it with ‘batch’. Badge, batch. The ending of ‘badge’ is weak. Badge. The ending of ‘batch’ is stronger. ‘Batch’. That’s not the only difference. The unvoiced ending also makes the vowel a little bit shorter.</p>
<p>Badge, batch. They don’t sound quite the same. First of all, the ending of ‘batch’ is stronger. Badge, batch. CH, CH, instead of ch, ch. Also, the vowel is longer on the word ‘badge’. Vowels are a little longer before voiced endings in these kinds of minimal pairs. So, you have two clues to help figure out which word it is: the strength of the ending and the length of the vowel.</p>
<p>But, there is a time when the weak ending gets stronger. Do you know when that is? It’s when we link it to a word that begins with a vowel or diphthong. In a consonant to vowel link, it helps to think of the ending consonant as beginning the next word. So if you think of it as a beginning consonant, then it gets much stronger. Let’s go back to the word ‘flowers’, and put it in a phrase, ‘flowers on the table’. Flowers on, flowers on. Now I’m hearing a little bit more of a clear Z sound, zon [3x]. Flowers on. It’s stronger than when the word was at the end of a sentence. I love flowers. ss, ss, ss. Flowers on, zz, zz, zz. So if the ending, weak voiced consonant links into a vowel, it’s not really that weak anymore.</p>
<p>This topic was pretty advanced. So if you don’t understand, don’t worry. If you do, think of lightening ending voiced consonants and see if that helps make the pronunciation of those words easier.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Practice-Multi-Syllable-Words"><a href="#How-to-Practice-Multi-Syllable-Words" class="headerlink" title="How to Practice Multi-Syllable Words"></a>How to Practice Multi-Syllable Words</h2><p>Learn how to break long words up and practice by stress:  stressed syllables on their own, and unstressed syllables together.</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to go over how to work on long words.</p>
<p>Multi-syllable words can be really tricky. There are so many sounds and transitions in them. So today we’re going to talk about how to work on multi-syllable words.</p>
<p>I encourage you to keep a running list of long words that have come up in conversation for you that are hard for you to say. Maybe they are words that relate to your field of study or work.</p>
<p>Let’s use as an example the word ‘underestimate’. First, look it up in the dictionary and get the IPA. But what I really want to talk about today is, make sure you know what syllables are stressed. This is a five-syllable word with stress on the middle syllable. There is secondary stress in this word, marked by the little line at the bottom. I’m going to say, don’t worry about that. They’re more like unstressed syllables than stressed syllables.</p>
<p>Let’s start by just practicing the stressed syllable. Es. Do you know the shape of a stressed syllable? I made a video a long time ago about how the voice should curve up and then down in a stressed syllable. The sounds are the most important in this stressed syllable – they should be the clearest in your word. Practice just the stressed syllable using a hand movement, the shape is really important in making the word sound natural. Es, es. Maybe even try it in slow motion. Es.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the rest of the syllables. We have two before and two after. Practice these syllables together, there’s no need to practice them separately like the stressed syllable.</p>
<p>First we have ‘under’. These syllables should be really different than the stressed one, es. Under, under. What’s different? They’re a little quieter, less clear, they don’t have that shape. There’s less energy in the voice. Under – es – timate. Two more syllables, also unstressed. under-, -timate. There’s less mouth movement for these unstressed syllables, isn’t there? under-, -timate. They’re simpler. At the beginning of the video, I talked about how long words can be hard because there are so many sounds, but I want you to see that in unstressed syllables, the sounds don’t have to be fully formed and fully pronounced. These sounds are quieter, flatter in pitch, faster, simpler. under-, -timate. This should make long words easier, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to practice them. You do, you need repeat a new word over and over, but the point is to break it up into simplified and stressed syllables.</p>
<p>Let’s keep working on it: under – es –timate [2x]. Underestimate [3x].</p>
<p>Let’s try another word: inevitable. First, look up the stress. The second syllable is stressed, which we know because of the mark before it. So let’s break it down. Ev, ev, ev. In – ev – itable, -itable, -itable, -itable. In – ev – itable. Inevitable [3x].</p>
<p>Put together a list of long words and work through them this way. I really think that breaking up a word into stressed and unstressed syllables is the best way to master it, along with repetition. The more you get used to the contrast of stressed and unstressed syllables, the better. Stress really matters in American English.</p>

<h2 id="Tongue-Flexibility-and-the-N"><a href="#Tongue-Flexibility-and-the-N" class="headerlink" title="Tongue Flexibility and the N"></a>Tongue Flexibility and the N</h2><p>Tagged With: <a href="https://rachelsenglish.com/tag/exercises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exercises</a>, <a href="https://rachelsenglish.com/tag/tom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom</a></p>
<p>Practice relaxing the tongue when saying words and phrases with N.  Tom teaches you to train yourself to use the tongue and not the jaw when working with words and phrases with the N for more natural speech.</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to invite Tom to give you a practice tip on tongue flexibility.</p>
<p>Tom and I have been working together on Rachel’s English since 2012. He is a fantastic teacher and pronunciation coach. And I’ve invited him here today to give you a practice tip. Take it away, Tom!</p>
<p>Tongue flexibility is at the core of speaking English as clearly as possible. I notice with many of my students that when they need to use the N consonant, they will often use tension in the jaw to help out. Native speakers of English do not use tension to create these sounds – so, of course, using tension does create an “accent”.</p>
<p>This is an exercise I use in my lessons to practice tongue flexibility. Drop your jaw to an easy open position so that you can see clearly into your mouth when looking into a mirror or the camera on your laptop or phone. Then, reaching up just with the tip of the tongue, make the N consonant sound, nn, and drop the tongue back into a lower position in the mouth for an AH vowel, nah, nah. Do this three times slowly, nah, nah, nah. Now, try and speed up a little, without letting the jaw start moving up and down, keep the jaw relaxed and open. Nah, nah, nah. Then speed up and see how fast you can go. Nah, nah, nah, nahnahnah, etc.</p>
<p>We use this tongue flexibility in words like ‘another’ or ‘banana’. If I say those words with a tense jaw that has to move with my N consonant – the rhythm of my speech gets a little choppy. Instead, keep the jaw relaxed and let the tongue do the work. ‘Another’ ‘banana’, banana, another. This also helps the rhythm of your speech in phrases: ‘He’s on a TV show’, on a, He’s on a TV show. ‘a ton of fun’, a ton of, ton of, a ton of fun.</p>
<p>Notice, even at the end of the word ‘fun’, you can still let the tongue do the work and leave the jaw a bit more relaxed. Fun, -un, fun. Using your tongue in this more flexible way, and letting the jaw stay more relaxed as you speak, does great things for the rhythm of your speech, and, eventually, should lead to a more effortless way of speaking English.</p>
<p>Practice on your own with that lowered and relaxed jaw and begin building your tongue flexibility.</p>
<p>Tom, thank you so much. That was great. If you’re interested in working 1-on-1, I cannot recommend Tom enough. He is a world-class pronunciation coach. And, he still has room in his schedule for a few more students. So, if you’re interested, check out this page.</p>

<h2 id="SOFT-PALATE-EXERCISES-—-Vocal-Exercises"><a href="#SOFT-PALATE-EXERCISES-—-Vocal-Exercises" class="headerlink" title="SOFT PALATE EXERCISES — Vocal Exercises"></a>SOFT PALATE EXERCISES — Vocal Exercises</h2><p>Tagged With: <a href="https://rachelsenglish.com/tag/exercises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exercises</a></p>
<p>What exactly is the soft palate?  It is the soft part of the roof of your mouth.  When it’s lowered, it makes sounds nasal, like the NG sound in American English.  English has no nasal vowels, so having a lowered soft palate can affect the placement and sound of your speech.</p>
<p>As part of our series on relaxation and placement, this video talks about the soft palate.</p>
<p>An overall nasal sound can be caused either by tension in the throat, or by a lowered soft palate. When the soft palate is lowered, it allows some air to come through here, into the nasal cavity. That makes the voice live more in the face than in the body. Luckily there is a very easy way to tell if this is a problem for you. If you put your fingers on the bridge of your nose, you will feel it vibrate if your soft palate is lowered. Try it. Put your fingers here and say NN-AH. I feel a vibration for the N, which has a lowered soft palate, but not for the AH, which has a raised soft palate.</p>
<p>There are only three sounds in English that are nasal, with a lowered soft palate. They are N, M, and NG. Many other languages have nasal vowels,where the soft palate is down, including Mandarin, Polish, Hindi, French, and Portuguese. If your native language has nasal vowels, you’ll really want to pay attention to this.</p>
<p>First, test yourself. Let’s take the word ON. It has the AH as in FATHER vowel and the N consonant. Say it slowly, holding your nose. ON. Were you able to make the vowel with no vibration? Another word, SONG, has the AW as in LAW vowel followed by the NG consonant, song. Were you able to make the vowel with no vibration?</p>
<p>A lot of my students get concerned with the idea of raising and lowering the soft palate. It’s sort of hard to feel, and hard see. So I’ve told them just to focus on keeping it lifted. Somehow this does not interfere with the nasal consonants. I’ve never had a student fix their overall sound by keeping the soft palate raised, but then mess up their nasal consonants. So just focus on keeping it lifted.</p>
<p>How do you lift it. There are a few ways to get used to the feeling and the idea. One way to get used to feeling your soft palate is to suck through a straw. When you suck through a straw, your soft palate automatically closesto prevent the liquid from going up into your nasal cavity. So, see if you can feel it close. And if you can’t then try sucking up through the straw and holding it there. If you hold it, that might make you more aware of the feeling here, especially when you let go. See if you feel anything release. So go ahead, open a can of soda, treat yourself to that, and practice feeling your soft palate.</p>
<p>Another method that may help you lift your soft palate is to just think of creating more space back here. If you’re creating more space, you may automatically lift your soft palate to accommodate that. So you can focus on creating space in the back of your mouth or throat as you talk.</p>
<p>Another way to feel your soft palate is to watch yourself raising and lowering it. Switch back and forth between AH and NG. When you make the NG, of course, you’re lowering your palate. So switch back and forth between the two, and try to keep your tongue in the same position. That means it’s yoursoft palate that has to move. Watch yourself in a mirror. I’ll demonstrate now,so you should see what that looks like.</p>
<p>So, the soft palate: it’s hard to see and hard to feel, but it does play an important role in the placement of the voice in American English. Play around with these exercises, especially the last one, and see if you can get used to the idea of keeping your soft palate raised in all vowel sounds andmost consonant sounds in American English.</p>

<p>To achieve the low placement of American English, you have to speak with a relaxed body and face.  This video helps you release tension in the neck and throat.</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to go over neck and throat relaxation exercises.</p>
<p>When we help students find the UH sound, which we consider the core sound of American English, we often suggest finding a chest resonance, or a lower resonance, to help them find this sound.  The way to find that lower resonance is to relax your neck and throat, and connect the vibrations of your sound to your body.  Here are a few exercises to help relax your neck and throat and access that body connection.</p>
<p>First, let’s just relax the head down, chin to chest, and massage the back and sides of the neck.</p>
<p>>&gt; I can do that.</p>
<p>This should feel really good.</p>
<p>>&gt; Oh it does!</p>
<p>Feel free to give your shoulders some love.  You may also feel like sighing as you do this, a nice easy sound carried by easy breath.</p>
<p>>&gt; Great.</p>
<p>Now let’s roll our head around, starting slowly, just let your head hang down, with the chin on the chest, and start to gently roll it back and forth.  Just a little bit, don’t go too far. Stay slow, and then start rolling it up even further on each side. Then eventually, you can go around the whole circle.</p>
<p>>&gt; How’s that feel Tom?<br>>&gt; That feels really good.</p>
<p>Now as you go around the full circle, if you feel any spot that feels tense, that you feel a little bit of ache in as you go around, really focus on that. Maybe get in there with your fingers and rub that out, so that you can go ahead and free the neck all the way around.</p>
<p>Now drop one ear to your left shoulder, while you do this, gently reach your right hand towards the ground, you’ll feel a little stretch in the right side of your neck.  Don’t go too far, just do what feels good to release.  Then switch sides.</p>
<p>>&gt; How you doing there Tom?<br>>&gt; This is great!</p>
<p>Now, leading with your eyes, look over your left shoulder, as far as you can (but, of course, don’t hurt yourself!!), and switch.</p>
<p>Here’s one that may feel a little bit weird at first.  Let’s start with a very relaxed face, the jaw should be relaxed and possibly hanging open just a little bit.  Let’s just sigh, nice full breath in, and a relaxed sigh out. Let a little sound out with the sigh, let the vibrations from the sound relax the throat even more.  Now, put both hands on either side of your larynx, and very gently jiggle it back and forth.  As you do this, continue your easy breath in and easy sigh out.  If you’re able to do this, then it means your throat is relaxed because it’s impossible to do this with a lot of throat tension.</p>
<p>Lastly, let’s rub our hands together so they’re nice and warm and then place them around the neck.  A natural heating pad, though it cools down a little too quickly!</p>
<p>Now, with your newly relaxed neck and throat, sigh on AH and see if you can feel the vibration in the chest.  This relaxation will really come in handy as you work on your American English.</p>
<p>A lot of my students who speak with natural throat tension because of their native language have a hard time identifying the tension, because it’s so normal to them. So one way to work with this, to try to move your placement down is just to think of opening up the neck some. And all of these exercises will help. So go through all of these exercises, and then think of an opening sensation, so that your voice can rest more here. Any time there’s tension in the neck, it brings the placement up higher. But we want the American English placement to feel like it’s coming from here.</p>

<p>To achieve the low placement of American English, you have to speak with a relaxed body and face. This video helps you release tension in the tongue.</p>
<p>In this American English Pronunciation video, we’re going to go over tongue relaxation exercises.</p>
<p>From the L to the R to the T, the tongue is very important when it comes to articulation of all kinds of sounds. So having a relaxed tongue that can move quickly and efficiently is a very good thing.  Let’s learn how to relax this very strong muscle.</p>
<p>Just how strong is the tongue?  Very!  It’s considered the strongest muscle in the body in relation to it’s size.  One way to see how strong it is is to put your pinky finger to the roof of your mouth, then pin the pinky finger to the roof of the mouth with the tongue. Like that. Now, have a tongue vs. pinky war. If you’re like me, your tongue wins every time, and your pinky hurts.</p>
<p>So let’s relax this mega-muscle.</p>
<p>First, stick out your tongue (make sure you have clean hands for this), and massage your tongue.  Now this may feel weird, but it’s a good way to get to know this muscle that works so hard for us.</p>
<p>>&gt; I’ve never done that before.<br>>&gt; It’s strange. It’s a strange feeling. But actually, kind of feels good.</p>
<p>Now, stick your tongue out again, and this time, see if you can go from relaxed, to pointed, to relaxed, and back and forth, without tensing the rest of the face.  So.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, ok.<br>It’s hard to do it without tensing your lips.<br>Yeah.<br>You can get there eventually. But just to start, just begin exploring that ability.<br>Maybe give them a side-angle of that.<br>Sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright. At first, you may feel like you need to tense the lips and jaw to tense the tongue, but eventually, you’ll be able to isolate the tension to the tongue alone.</p>
<p>Then, keeping the tip of the tongue behind the front teeth, where it stays for almost all vowel sounds, do some tongue push ups, or push outs, to be more accurate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh. I’ve never seen that before.<br>So you’ll stick out the middle of the tongue, giving the tongue a good stretch.<br>Wow, you’re really good at that. Did you learn this in acting school?<br>I did.<br>Ok.<br>I spent a lot of time doing these exercises in school.<br>Let me try. It’s hard if you’re not used to it.<br>Yeah. It’s a little bit of a strange movement. But again, doing this will help you have a great relationship with all of what’s happening in your mouth, so that when you’re working with a teacher, or when you’re working with yourself, and you learn about where the tongue is supposed to be, it may become easier to do that new movement, or action with your tongue, because you’ve been able to have these exercises.<br>Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, one way to help yourself it so put your hand in front of your tongue and reach towards your hand. Give yourself a bit of a challenge.</p>
<p>>&gt; Oh wow.<br>>&gt; Now, I’ll never reach my hand, but it’s something to reach for.</p>
<p>Now, my least favorite exercise, bit a great one for the tongue.  We’re going to circle the tongue around the mouth in both directions.  Now, imagine that you’ve got peanut butter stuck on your gums, and you’re going to circle the tongue around trying to get the peanut butter out.</p>
<p>>&gt; I kind of like that one.<br>>&gt; Yeah?<br>>&gt; Yeah. Why is that your least favorite?<br>>&gt; Because when you do it 10 times one way and 10 times the other way, you, your tongue starts to really get sore. So work up to ten times one way, and then switch to ten times the other way.  But you can start with 5.</p>
<p>Now, drop your head, relax the tongue out of the mouth, and shake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh boy. Do I have to try that?<br>Give it a shot.<br>Ok. I better hold my hair.<br>Perfect. Such relaxation.<br>Yep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, you should feel the tongue release all the way in the back of the mouth.  And as you do this, some saliva may fly around. And if so, congratulations. You’re doing it perfectly.</p>
<p>Now, let’s practice some articulation with this newly relaxed tongue.</p>
<p>So, that’s using the unvoiced T sound. Now let’s try the voiced D sound.</p>
<p>And you can just feel the very tip of your tongue on the gum ridge there for that nice, light touch. Efficient T and D. Let’s try.</p>
<p>And then, some fun practice. Trumpet players call this “double tonguing”. It’s to articulate the tongue in the front, with the tip of the tongue for the T, and then a K sound with the back.</p>
<p>>&gt; Oh wow. When you do that you just feel your tongue going back and forth.<br>>&gt; Yeah, it’s really fun.<br>>&gt; That’s kind of cool.</p>
<p>Alright, nice job. Remember, this is a great way to get to know your tongue, and may be really helpful when it comes to dealing with complicated consonant clusters that involve the tongue in words like: strike, plurals, and twelfth. Those are tough ones.</p>
<p>Some of my students have a hard time moving their tongue without moving their jaw. So, as you do some of these exercises, make sure you do some holding the jaw firm, so that the tongue is moving independently, like this.</p>
<p>You should be able to do it without moving the jaw at all. If you’re having a hard time, try holding on to the jaw lightly to really focus your effort on the tongue.</p>

<p>To achieve the low placement of American English, you have to speak with a relaxed body and face.  This video helps you release tension in the jaw.</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to go over jaw relaxation.</p>
<p>Hello and Welcome to Rachel’s English.  Today, we’re going to talk about ways to relax the jaw.<br>>&gt; Ow.<br>>&gt; Yeah, that looked painful!<br>>&gt; Yeah. That was painful.</p>
<p>Many of our students have a tendency to hold a bunch of tension in the jaw, whether as a habit from their native language, or because they are focusing on learning a bunch of new sounds.  In American English, we want a relaxed face and throat, and body if possible.  But today, we’re going to focus on relaxing the jaw.  Here are a few exercises you can use before you practice or in the middle of your practice when you feel tension creeping in.</p>
<p>First off, you may have heard from teachers in the past that you need to drop your jaw more.  More Jaw Drop!!  This instruction can create tension as you work on vowel and diphthong sounds that need a bunch of space – like AH, AW, and AI, and others.  Instead of thinking about using your muscles to hold the jaw open, which can add tension to the face, think of releasing the jaw.  Let the jaw drop down using gravity, rather than muscle.</p>
<p>If you put your fingers just under your ears and open and close your mouth, you’ll feel movement of the jaw bone, we’ll call this spot the “jaw hinge”.  Think of releasing your jaw from back here, rather than forcing the chin down.  By doing this, we lose the tension that can affect the sound, and we have a fuller more open sound.  We’ll come back to the hinge.  But first, let’s start some jaw relaxation exercises.</p>
<p>Let’s start by just easily massaging the jaw with your fingertips.  As you begin freeing the jaw, you may start to yawn more – awesome!  Keep yawning!  It’s a great stretch and provides you with wonderful deep breaths that encourage support. When you yawn, make sure you yawn both vertically and horizontally. Really get a great stretch for the jaw, and the lips actually for that one.</p>
<p>Now, using the heel of your hand, drag the hand down the jaw bone on the face towards your chin, really thinking about releasing that jaw hinge and letting the face muscles relax.</p>
<p>>&gt; I look silly. But it is relaxing.<br>>&gt; Totally ok to look silly. It’s great, actually.<br>>&gt; Oh, that feels so good.</p>
<p>Now, let’s go back to that hinge we spoke about earlier, back here.  Allow your newly relaxed jaw to release down for a moment and feel that space that opens up under your ear as the hinge releases down.  This is a great pressure point on our face, by pressing in to it we can release the jaw even more.  Now, this can feel quite painful, so don’t hurt yourself, but it will feel great when you let go!</p>
<p>Now, take your chin between thumb and index finger and move the jaw up and down.</p>
<p>>&gt; Whoa. Oh, that’s hard.<br>>&gt; Don’t hurt yourself on this one, either.<br>>&gt; You gotta watch your tongue!<br>>&gt; It can be very difficult! Yeah, make sure your tongue’s not in the way.</p>
<p>Really let your hand control your jaw, you’ll feel the jaw kind of want to fight back a little bit. See if you can relax it, and just let your hand be in control.</p>
<p>>&gt; Yeah, my jaw definitely does not want to give up control.<br>>&gt; Yeah. So, lots, lots to work on.</p>
<p>Now, if you haven’t felt silly already, prepare to. And if you’re really relaxed, prepare to let a little saliva fly around.  Now, clasp your hands together and shake your body and face, keeping that jaw released.</p>
<p>>&gt; I don’t know if I’m willing to do that on camera.<br>>&gt; Come on Rachel.<br>>&gt; Ok. Do it again?</p>
<p>Let’s use this newly released jaw a bit and practice on some vowel sounds, some vowel sounds that use some jaw drop. So AH and AW. Now, let’s go from OO, which has a tight lip rounding here, OO, and move into AW</p>
<p>OO-AW, OO-AW</p>
<p>Now, let’s move from OO into AH: OO-AH, OO-AW</p>
<p>You can practice going back and forth, and this may help you hear the difference between those two sounds.</p>
<p>All right!  Hopefully your jaw feels more relaxed.  Remember to do this whenever you feel tension creep in as you practice and drill, and when you’re having trouble finding the difference between vowel sounds. It may just be that you want more space – and the best way to create space – is to release that jaw!</p>

<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
<h2 id="The-Path-of-the-Voice"><a href="#The-Path-of-the-Voice" class="headerlink" title="The Path of the Voice"></a>The Path of the Voice</h2><p>Knowing how the voice works will help advance your ideas and knowledge about placement. Think about this as you try to sound more American.  Placement makes a big difference</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to study the path of the voice and placement.</p>
<p>One of the things I often talk about with my students is placement.  I sometimes feel like their voice only comes from their head, and is placed very much so here, whereas my voice, when I speak English, rests more here.  And I feel the placement a little lower.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a little bit about what happens when you’re speaking.  So, the diaphragm, here, an involuntary muscle, just like you’re heart, tenses up, which pulls down a little bit.  That turns your lungs into a vacuum, and it sucks the air in.  When your diaphragm relaxes, the air then comes out.  Your vocal cords here are what make the sound.  Think of blowing up a balloon, and taking the neck of it, pulling it wide so it makes that annoying squeak sound.  That’s what your vocal cords are.  So, your lungs are the balloon, and your vocal cords are the mouth of the balloon.  And this pressure here is the energy of the voice.</p>
<p>So this is the energy, the fuel of the voice, and up here we have the articulators:  the tongue, the teeth, the jaw.  That takes the core sound made by the vocal cords, and shapes them into the sounds of American English.</p>
<p>I feel like many of my students lack a connection to this fuel, to the energy.  And they speak only from their face.  Of course their body works in the same way, they’re bringing in the air, but they seem to have no attachment to it.  And their voice seems completely detached from their bodies.  But when I speak, I feel my voice very attached to my body.</p>
<p>One exercise you can do to try to focus on your body rather than your face when you’re speaking, is just to exaggerate the movement here, tss, tss, of your abdoment, tss, zz, tss, zz, to connect more to a lower sensation of the breath.  Now you wouldn’t want to do that when you’re speaking, but it could be a good exercise for you, to get you into your body.</p>
<p>So here we have the fuel and here the articulation.  Now, we want our articulators to be very relaxed.  If there’s any tension, in the throat, for example, it will bring the voice up, and the placement up, and then we loose the connection here to the fuel of the voice, to the body.</p>
<p>We’re currently working on a series of videos dealing with relaxation to help you get the voice out of your face and head and into your body.  In the mean time, just play around with the idea of pulling the air all the way down, ss, zz, and fueling your voice from here, a lower spot in your body.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

<h2 id="English-A-Stress-Timed-Language"><a href="#English-A-Stress-Timed-Language" class="headerlink" title="English: A Stress-Timed Language"></a>English: A Stress-Timed Language</h2><p>In some languages, every syllable is the same length. In English, it sounds very awkward to make each syllable the same length.  It’s important to have contrast, some long and some short syllables.</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to go over why some words sound different when they’re said on their own than they do when they’re said as part of a sentence, like ‘for’, ‘fer’.</p>
<p>A lot of people think, when they’re studying a language and they’re new to it, that they need to pronounce each word fully and clearly in order to be well-understood.  But in English that’s actually not the case.  English is a stress-timed language.  That means some syllables will be longer, and some will be shorter.  Many languages, however, are syllable-timed, which means each syllable has the same length.  Examples of syllable-timed languages:  French, Spanish, Cantonese.  So, when an American hears a sentence of English, with each syllable having the same length, it takes just a little bit longer to get the meaning.  This is because we are used to stressed syllables, syllables that will pop out of the line because they’re longer and they have more shape.  Our ears, our brains, go straight to those words.  Those are the content words.  When all syllables are the same length, then there’s no way for the ear to know which words are the most important.</p>
<p>So this is why stress is so important in American English.  It’s a stress-timed language.  When you give us nice shape in your stressed syllables, you’re giving us the meaning of the sentence.  This means that other syllables need to be unstressed — flatter, quicker — so that the stressed syllables are what the ear goes to.  This is why it’s so important to reduce function words that can reduce in American English.  When those function words are part of a whole, part of a sentence, they are pronounced differently.  Let’s look at some examples.</p>
<p>—-.  Do you know what I’m saying?  A native speaker might not either.  But, in the context of a sentence, “I’m going to the store,” a native speaker would know exactly what I was saying.  I’m going to the store.  I’m going to the store.  When ‘to the’ is pronounced —- (reduced and linked), ‘going’ and ‘store’ become the obvious words in that sentence.  I’m going to the store.</p>
<p>What about —-?  Can you understand what I’m saying?  A native speaker might not either.  But, in the sentence fragment “Because of my job,” “Because of my job,” a native speaker would know exactly what I was saying.  Because of my job.  Because of my job.  ‘Because’ and ‘of’ are so unstressed, so reduced and low in pitch, that the word ‘job’ is able to really jump out of the sentence.  Because of my job.</p>
<p>This is really of primary importance in American English pronunciation.  As you’re working on pronunciation, keep in mind this idea of a word being part of a whole.</p>
<p>The word ‘for’:  part of a word becomes fer, fer, fer you, fer me, fer dinner.  Practice it this way.  Drill it over and over.  Other words that can reduce:  ‘and’ can become ‘n’.  ‘Them’ can become ‘thum’ or ’em’.  ‘At’ can become ‘ut’.  ‘To’ can become ‘tuh’ or ‘duh’.  ‘Can’ can become ‘kun’, ‘kun’.  ‘Are’ can become ‘er’, ‘er’.  ‘Was’ can become ‘wuz’, ‘wuz’.  ‘That’ can become ‘thut’, ‘thut’.  ‘Your’ can become ‘yer’, ‘yer’.  ‘At the’ can become ‘ut the’, ‘ut the’.  And so on.  So keep an eye out for this as you’re studying pronunciation and listening to native speakers.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
<p>I’m excited to announce that I’m running another online course, so do check out my website for details.  You’ll find on there all sorts of information about the course, who should take the course, and requirements.  I really hope you’ll check it out and consider signing up.  I’ve had a blast with my first online course, and I’m looking forward to getting to know you.</p>
<p>Don’t stop there.  Have fun with my real-life English videos.  Or get more comfortable with the IPA in this play list.  Learn about the online courses I offer, or check out my latest video.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Pronounce-Any-Word"><a href="#How-to-Pronounce-Any-Word" class="headerlink" title="How to Pronounce Any Word"></a>How to Pronounce Any Word</h2><p>I’ve made a lot of videos that go over how to pronounce specific words, but I can’t make a video for every word.  This video shows you resources that already exist on the internet to help you pronounce any word.</p>
<p>I often get emails from users asking how to pronounce specific words. Today I’m going to show you three different online resources that will help you figure this out on your own. First, dictionary.com. Let’s use the word ‘attain’.The default on dictionary.com is their own pronunciation guide. But you can see the link here, show IPA, and when you click it, it brings up the international phonetic alphabet transcription of the word — the same pronunciation symbols that my website uses. So you can see here, ‘attain’ begins with the unaccented schwa syllable. This little mark means that the next syllable is stressed. So the stressed syllable begins with the T consonant, has the ‘ay’ as in ‘say’ diphthong, and the N consonant. Whenyou press the speaker icon, you can hear a short audio clip of a native speaker saying the word. Attain.The next site I want to show you is the Cambridge Dictionary of American English. So again, we’ll look up the word ‘attain’. Here you see the IPA transcription of the word. And again, there’s a speaker icon, where you can hear a different native speaker saying the word. Attain. So, in both of these great resources, you can hear the word pronounced by a native speaker, but you can also see the International Phonetic Alphabet transcription of the word.</p>
<p>And here’s a site called howjsay.com. Again, we’ll look at the word ‘attain’. Attain. There’s no transcription here, but again you get a third opportunity to hear a different person saying the word. To hear the word a second time,just move the cursor over the word again. Attain. The default pronunciation for this site is British English. But for some words they will give you both British English and American English. For example, on the word ‘water’. Water, American, water. One thing I really like about this site is that you can type multiple words separated by a semicolon to bring them up in one batch.Then you can move quickly from audio file to audio file. This will help you if you have multiple words that sound the same to you — if you’re not quite sure how to differentiate the words. Seen, sing. I encourage you to take advantage of these wonderful free resources on the web as you work on your pronunciation. That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
<h2 id="Mouth-Position-Study"><a href="#Mouth-Position-Study" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Position Study"></a>Mouth Position Study</h2><p>Tagged With: <a href="https://rachelsenglish.com/tag/test-yourself/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Test Yourself</a></p>
<p>The mouth positions define the sounds.  Can you guess the sound by looking at the shape of the mouth?</p>
<p>In this video, we’re going to focus on the correct mouth position for the various sounds in American English.</p>
<p>Today we’re going to look at freeze frames of the mouth in various different positions, and we’ll guess what sound is being produced. It’s important to know well the positions of the different sounds. The correct position is the key to the correct pronunciation. Let’s get started.</p>
<p>What sound do you think is being made here? The lips are closed, but clearly the mouth is not at rest. This is the M sound, where the lips are closed but the vocal cords make noise. M isn’t the only sound that is made with closed lips. B and P are also made by releasing closed lips. This is the B sound, bb. What sound do you think we have here? Corners of the lips are pulled back, and the top lip is a little raised, showing some of the top teeth.You can see that the tongue is coming down in the front, touching behind the bottom front teeth. And it’s raised in the back, because we can see quite a bit of the tongue. This is the AA vowel, aa. Notice how much the jaw is dropped for this sound. And what sound is being made here? The bottom lip has been pulled up and is touching the bottom of the top front teeth. That means it is either the F or the V sound. In this case, it was the V. But both the F and the V take this same position. What sound is this? The lips are flared, and the teeth are together. There are actually four sounds that have this mouth position: SH, DJ, CH, and JJ. Here, I was saying the word ‘generally’, so it was the JJ sound. What sound is this? The tongue is coming through the teeth. If you guessed the TH, you’re correct. This can either be the voiced or the unvoiced TH. The L can also have this shape. Some people do bring the tongue tip to the bottom of the front teeth, rather than to the hard palate to make the L sound. What sound is this? The lips are making a tight circle. This is the W consonant sound. What sound is this? The lips are parted, but the teeth are together. In this particular photo, it is the Z sound, zz, in the word ‘because’. It’s the same mouth position as the S sound. The true T and D sounds are also made in part by the teeth being together with the lips parted. The sound is made complete when the teeth part and the air comes out. What sound is this? The lips have come in,yet it looks a little less round than the W. This is a beginning R, in the word ‘reduce’. If you could see it from the side, you would see that as the corners have come in, the lips do come away from the face as they round.</p>
<p>In closing, we are going to watch speech with the sound turned off. This is to help you focus on the mouth. I want you to see how much the mouth really is moving to make these different sounds. When you practice English, use a mirror sometimes, and watch your mouth. Make sure that your lips rrrrrrrround enough to make the R sound, and that your tongue comes th-th-th-through the teeth for the TH. Let’s watch.</p>

<p>What is the difference between voiced consonants and unvoiced consonants?  For voiced consonants, the vocal cords are engaged, making sound.  For unvoiced consonants, the vocal cords are not making sound, there is just air passing through them.</p>
<p>Voiced and unvoiced consonants. Many consonants in English are paired together because one is the unvoiced version of the other. They take the same mouth position, and the same tongue position. But in one of them, you just go ‘hhh,’ passing air. In the other one, you actually make a sound: uh, uh. For example: ch, ch. Only air is coming through my teeth. Jj, jj: I’m making an ‘uh, uh’ sound here. Within the pairs, the unvoiced sounds are: tt, ff, pp, kk, th, ss, sh, ch. The voiced sounds of those are: dd, vv, bb, gg, th, zz, dj, jj. And in the consonants that have no pair, there is only one that is unvoiced. And that is the hh as in ‘hi.’ The others are all voiced. mm, nn, ng, ll, rr, yy, ww.</p>
