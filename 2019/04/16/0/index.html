<p>Give me 10 minutes and I’ll show you the 5 phases of acquiring the perfect American English accent (via a conversation about POTTY TRAINING!)</p>
<p>You’re learning a lot about American English pronunciation. How Americans talk and how to sound American. And as you’ve learned, you’ve started to become aware of all of your English habits that you’d like to change. You start to become incredibly frustrated. It feels impossible to take what you’re learning about pronunciation and apply it to actual real conversations that you’re having. In this video, we’re going to talk about the process that takes you from knowing something to being able to do it regularly without even having to think about it. </p>
<p>As i’ve been raising my son who’s two, I have noticed lots of little things that made me think about teaching my adult students and accent training. One of the things that’s so different about pronunciation training is that it’s different for most of the learning we do as adults. When you were learning English, you were likely learning it as knowledge for the mind, which is what almost all of the learning we do as older children and adults is, at least here in the US.</p>
<p>We’re learning things to know, like memorizing vocabulary or English verb conjugations. Things that you can write and talk about. Training in a sport or on a musical instrument or singing is a lot more like working on your accent than studying English is. Some people think I’m an English teacher. I correct them.</p>
<p>I’m not. That’s not how I think about myself at all. I’m primarily an accent trainer. I try to figure out how to help students understand and change their habits to be more comfortable and confident speaking English. A while ago, I was reading a book about raising kids that really reminded me of the different phases of learning when working on your accent. I talked through this same sequence all the time with my adult students. And you know what the book was about? It was about potty training. That’s right.</p>
<p>This is where Stoney was learning something totally new about his body and I had to try to understand his experience, to help guide him through it. The book said this: the first phase is diapers. From newborn until it starts to become something that he notices or we start talking about. Think of a newborn. Total unawareness about something like peeing. This is phase one. As he moves out of diapers he has to start noticing something about his body that he hadn’t</p>
<p>Paid attention to before. This is phase two. This isn’t just like my adult students working on their accent and being easily understood when speaking.</p>
<p>You’re starting to notice something about your body, the way that you sound, that you hadn’t necessarily paid attention to before or even known how to pay attention to.</p>
<p>The book talked about how first, Stoney will notice after he’s peed. He’ll be able to say: I peed. Of course that’s disappointing if your goal is not to have your kid pee his pants. But it’s a necessary step in this process. This is not a habit yet. He’s still understanding what’s happening. This is phase two. He no longer has total unawareness, he now has awareness when something has happened. Phase three is being able to tell me when he’s peeing as it’s actually happening. So phase two is past.</p>
<p>You notice it after it happens. Phase three is present. You notice it as you do it. Phase four, you may have been able to guess, is future. You think about it just before it happens. This is the phase he’s in now, thankfully, where he can say: I’m going to pee, or I need to pee. That’s a lot easier to deal with than: I peed or I’m peeing. And there’s a fifth phase.</p>
<p>That’s the phase where he doesn’t tell us anymore. It’s just part of normal life and he goes to the bathroom when he needs to. Let’s talk about these phases with changing a pronunciation habit.</p>
<p>Phase 1, total unawareness. You’ve never known about the sounds of American English or what you were doing wrong.</p>
<p>You’ve learned English but you’ve never specifically studied pronunciation. So when you first start studying, you learn all kinds of new things, like exactly how the AH vowel sounds that it’s not in your language and how it’s made.</p>
<p>That’s something you learn with the mind and that’s very satisfying. You could describe it and teach it to someone else. As I said, this is the kind of learning most of us do as adults. It’s moving from phase 1 to phase 2, total unawareness to understanding. But there are still three more transitions to make before making something a habit and this is where many of my students get frustrated. They’re stuck in Phase two, and that is you know you’re doing it wrong because you learned about it, you notice it, but you notice you’re still constantly doing it wrong in conversation.</p>
<p>You can’t think of what to say and pronunciation at the same time. You’re stuck in Phase two. The past phase. You notice it after you’ve already made a mistake. That can be very frustrating.</p>
<p>This is where some people want to give up. It’s their habit and they don’t see how they can ever change it. How can they ever think of two things at once? But you can get all the way to phase five. I always try to tell my students this is actually progress. You’ve gone from not knowing something at all to knowing it.</p>
<p>Don’t give up so early in the journey. For example, let’s say you’re working on getting the UH as in butter vowel to sound really natural and American. This one can be tough because it depends a lot on placement too. You’ve learned how it’s made and how it’s different from other sounds, you’ve listened to a lot of minimal pairs and now you can hear it as its own sound. You left phase one for phase two.</p>
<p>You have awareness. And you can practice it over and over. But when you’re in conversation, thinking about what to say, you find you still say it wrong. You notice it after it comes out of your mouth, and this feels really disappointing to you. This is where some students want to quit.</p>
<p>You’ve started training the sound, doing the repetitions to retrain your muscles. How do you bridge your practice time to real speaking in real conversation? It’s actually simple. Just more training. By noticing what you’re doing wrong, you can focus on your practice more. If there are any words that consistently don’t feel right, write them down. Make sure that’s one of the words that you’re training ten, twenty, or more times a day. You just need more repetitions of doing it right to change the habit. A great tool can be to record yourself.</p>
<p>Many people now have phones that can record audio. Record a conversation you have at some point during the day. Listen to it later. Now that you’ve increased your knowledge, you’ll be able to be your own teacher. You’ll be able to notice things that aren’t right, and you can write them down, and work with them over and over. This is great if there are certain words you’re using a lot for work or your daily life.</p>
<p>Take the words or phrases that intimidate you the most and practice them 20 or more times, several times throughout the day. This repetition is necessary but it will only take a few minutes. Practice it slowly and at regular pace. Imitate a native speaker by going to Forvo.com or Youglish.com to hear many samples.</p>
<p>This is how you bridge the gap between practicing and real conversation. It’s simply more focused practice on the actual words that you’ll use in your daily life. And as you train more and more, you’ll go through the same phases that Stoney went through for potty training. You’ll go from noticing your mistake after you’ve made it, phase 2, to phase 3 where as you start to stay the word, your brain gets triggered and you remember how you want to try to say it. Don’t be afraid to repeat your word with a better pronunciation.</p>
<p>As you do more training, you’ll be able to think about the right pronunciation just as your brain has come up with the word and you want to say it. And with more training and more time, you’ll no longer even think about it. Your confidence on a particular word or sound will be that high. You won’t need to think about it, you won’t notice it, it’s no longer a problem for you. So it can be very frustrating, because the first thing that happens after you learn something is realizing how often you do it wrong, and how hard it is to change a habit. That’s true. And the more you learn about pronunciation the more habits you’ll want to change but you can change them.</p>
<p>And don’t let the work that is necessary turn you off. You can do it. I’ve seen hundreds of students change their habit through regular training, repetition. A little hard work and the payoff is so big. If you get frustrated at the beginning, you’ll never move on to the next phase. But if you take it as a tool for learning, and you keep training, you will get there. You’ll get to where you want to be. What are some of your best tips for how you’ve worked on your accent and made a real change? Or for how you’ve stayed motivated? Maybe there’s a particular word that you couldn’t say correctly that you now say without effort.</p>
<p>Share the tips or tricks that you use in practicing and improving in the comments below. What is one major victory you’ve had while studying English? Share these things in the comments below so everyone can learn from you and feel motivated by you and your successes. And don’t forget, keep working. You can’t change a habit overnight, it does take some time and dedication, but it’s worth it, and you can do it. I believe in you.</p>
<p>That’s it and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

<p>Learn about two different ways of speaking English:  one is more horizontal, where you pull your lips wide, and one is more vertical, where you drop your jaw.  Which one sounds more natural?  Find out in this video.</p>
<p>Study with Rachel’s online courses in the Rachel’s English Academy.  Supercharge your conversation skills!  </p>
<p>Hi! I’m Tom Kelley, a Rachel’s English teacher. And I’m here to tell you to relax! Chances are you can. It’s really helpful when you’re speaking English. Today’s practice tip is about thinking “vertically” rather than “horizontally” when you speak – you’ll see what I mean in a second.</p>
<p>A lot of my students are amazed to discover that speaking English can actually take less effort than they are currently using. Today I’m going to talk about one area of the face in which I see a lot of effort being used – the lips. Some students tend to pull their lips back wide when speaking – I call this speaking horizontally. I’m going to do it for a second. It’s like a bit of a smile on my face. And it tends to limit how much I drop my jaw. It also changes the way I sound. It takes my vocal placement from a lower resonance, to a higher resonance. We want to keep that low, open chest resonance when speaking English.</p>
<p>There are a few sounds in English that might require a little bit of horizontal stretch from the lips. For instance, the EE as in ME vowel. Many students like to pull the lips back for this vowel sound. EE. EE. That’s fine. And you will achieve a clear EE vowel when you do that. But when you watch native speakers use words with the EE vowel – you’ll notice that if the lip corners pull back, it’s a very subtle movement. For example, ‘easy’. ‘Easy’. My lip corners are barely pulling wide. Most of the EE vowel is made with the middle of my tongue arching up in the mouth.</p>
<p>Another vowel sound that might use a little bit of lip movement is the AA as in Hat vowel. Many students will say “hat”, using a lot of lip tension. This tension can actually make your voice sound a little nasal. The vocal placement rises into the face and nasal passages. Hat. My hat is missing. Instead, let the lips stay a bit more relaxed and let the tongue position be more important. For this vowel the tongue is wide and arching slightly up and forward in the mouth. Hat. My hat is missing. Now the vocal placement sounds the same the whole way through the sentence. Only with relaxation can you find that chest resonance.</p>
<p>I really encourage you to use a mirror to check and see if this is something you do. If you find that you tend to pull the lips corners back a lot when you speak, see what happens if you speak “vertically”, rather than horizontally. This means relaxing the lips and letting the jaw drop down a bit more for stressed syllables.</p>
<p>Let’s run through some examples:</p>
<p>Bed. Speaking horizontally: bed. Speaking vertically: bed. It takes so much less effort to speak vertically.</p>
<p>Same. Horizontal: same. Vertical: same.</p>
<p>To do this, you may need to move your tongue more than you are used to. If you’ve been using lip and jaw tension for the AY diphthong, for example, chances are you are pulling your lips wide. Instead, just arch the middle of the tongue from a low, wide position in the mouth to a higher position. AY. AY. And let the lips relax. American English depends on a lot of flexible movement from the tongue so that the lips and jaw can stay relaxed.</p>
<p>How about a couple practice sentences:<br>I love vacation days. Avoid the horizontal: vacation days. And go vertical and relaxed. Vacation days. I love vacation days.</p>
<p>Take the empty chair in the back. Horizontal: Take the empty chair in the back. Vertical: Take the empty chair in the back. Again, hopefully you can hear how relaxing my lips and jaw ends up changing the placement of my voice and the sound of my vowels and diphthongs.</p>
<p>Use a mirror when you practice to see if you are speaking horizontally. If you are, cool! Now you know you get to relax. And it’s always great to remember that you’re allowed to relax.</p>

<p>Learn tips and tricks to increase your vocabulary.  First learn how to pick up new words, then learn tips for memorization.  Always study the pronunciation and practice words out loud!</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to over how to increase your vocabulary.</p>
<p>One of the challenges in learning a foreign language is remembering all of the new vocabulary. In this video, we’re going to go over a few tips for learning new words, and for remembering them.</p>
<p>First, expose yourself to the language. For example, read. I still learn English words from reading. I find that every couple of months the New York Times uses a word that either I’ve never heard before, or that I’ve heard but I’m not totally solid on the meaning. So I look it up, learn the meaning, and then go back to the sentence and solidify it. One good idea is to think of another word that you know that you could replace it with in that sentence. A word that wouldn’t change the meaning. Then say the sentence with that word. Tying the new word to a word you already know, and studying it in the context of the sentence will help you remember it.</p>
<p>If you know my channel, you know it’s a pronunciation channel. Always learn the pronunciation when you learn a new word. When you look up a word in the dictionary, the pronunciation is always right there. Many online dictionaries also play an audio file so you can hear a native speaker say the word. Practice it out loud several times.</p>
<p>You want to read at the right level to learn. If it’s too easy, you won’t learn many new vocabulary words. If it’s too hard, you don’t really get the context because there’s too much that you don’t know. Try reading at a level where you look up, at most, one word per sentence.</p>
<p>As you discover new words in your reading, write them down, along with the meaning and the context. You can either use a notebook, or flashcards if you prefer that. Make a system that works for you so you know you’re going to actually go back and study the words again. Most words you won’t remember from just looking it up once.</p>
<p>When you look the word up, look for related words or other forms of the word. For example, let’s say you’re learning the word ‘adjust’, which is a verb. You may find in the dictionary that ‘adjustable’ is an adjective and ‘adjustment’ is a noun. Write these down too.</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to look for one antonym or one synonym. An antonym is a word with an opposite meaning, and a synonym is a word with the same or similar meaning. So, let’s say you’re learning the word ‘blurry’. A synonym would be ‘fuzzy’. An antonym would be ‘clear’. If any of these words are unknown to you, write them down too. You can find synonyms and antonyms by looking in a thesaurus, like thesaurus.com.</p>
<p>Another great way to learn vocabulary is to watch TV, movies, and online videos. But you can’t just sit back, relax, and be entertained. You can do that sometimes, you’re going to learn more if you actively participate in learning. When I was in Germany, I watched a lot of TV with my notebook in hand. When I heard a word or phrase that I knew I could identify but didn’t know the meaning of, I immediately stopped paying attention to the television, or paused what I was watching, and wrote down the word. Then I looked up the meaning and wrote down the context. It was so easy to remember new words I picked up this way because I had the visual of what I had been seeing, I had the visual of the word written down, and I practiced out loud several times. The context of the situation helped solidify that word or phrase. If you can rewind and watch again, do this, and pay attention to the pronunciation. Imitate the pronunciation out loud 5 or 6 times. Make sure you write the pronunciation down, either using IPA or another system that works for you.</p>
<p>This is also great for learning phrases or sequences of words that are frequently used. When I was in Germany watching a drama, I heard the phrase: Es tut mir furchtbar leid. I had never heard this phrase before. I knew ‘es tut mir leid’, which means “I’m sorry”, so I recognized the phrase, and I learned a new way to intensify it with ‘furchtbar’. I’m terribly sorry.</p>
<p>When you learn a new phrase, write it down. Ok, so what do you do with all of these words and phrases you’re writing down? By learning them in the context of reading or video, you’re already helping yourself memorize them. But you’re still going to have to put in some work.</p>
<p>Try to memorize, really solidly memorize, 3-5 words a day. If you have a great memory, then maybe go for 10. But limit yourself to that.</p>
<p>Tip 1 for memorization: The Laura tip. I’m naming this after my friend who was studying Spanish abroad. Laura would write down and learn four or five new words that she heard in conversation throughout the day. At the end of the day, she would turn them into a song. This might involve gestures or movements to help her understand. It might contain just the word, if the gesture was clear, or the word and definition, or the word in a sentence. Adding music, adding a melody, really helps your brain hold onto information. She taught me one of her songs and I still remember it, 8 years later. And I wasn’t even trying to study Spanish at the time. Let’s come up with an example song. Let’s say you’re learning the words sprint, deceive, increase, and concern. Your song could go something like this:</p>
<p>Sprint! Don’t deceive me. Increase. I care because I’m concerned.</p>
<p>Don’t spend much time on it. It should be short and fun. Sing it 10 or 12 times. Then sing the one from yesterday a few times. Adding motion and melody will help you memorize. It doesn’t matter at all what the melody is, or even if you’re musical. It will still help you remember.</p>
<p>Tip 2 for memorization: Repetition and grouping.</p>
<p>Go over your vocabulary words many times. Practice them out loud. Repetition is extremely important. If it’s a tough word to pronounce, slow it down, don’t rush: immediately [4x]. Put the words in groups and drill the groups together. Then group them differently and drill again. For example, if you wrote down 10 words or phrases while watching one episode of the Sopranos, practice those words together and think about the episode and the context for each word. Or, group them by vowel sound in the stressed syllable, for example, furniture, unearth, burley, return, jury, blurt, curse. These words all had the UR vowel in the stressed syllable. Or, organize your words by stress: typical, period, numerous, everything, difficult, curious, DA-da-da. These were all three-syllable words with stress on the first syllable. Or, organize the words by meaning, grouping together words of similar meaning. Or group them by how well you know them, putting words you know really well in one group, words you kind of know in a second group, and words you need a lot of help with in a third group. Creating various groups will help you memorize, and will make drilling vocabulary more engaging.</p>
<p>Tip 3: Visualization. When you learn a word, come up with a picture for it, a mini-story in one picture in your mind that makes sense to you. This is a common mnemonic device, and you probably used it when learning vocabulary in your own language.</p>
<p>So, absorb as much of the language as you can through reading and watching video, or even writing down words from conversation around you. Organize these words in a system that works for you: maybe a notebook, maybe flashcards. And get creative when memorizing. The more often you come back and study your vocabulary words, the more you’ll be able to remember them and to use them yourself in writing and conversation.</p>

<h2 id="Ending-Voiced-vs-Unvoiced-Consonants"><a href="#Ending-Voiced-vs-Unvoiced-Consonants" class="headerlink" title="Ending Voiced vs. Unvoiced Consonants"></a>Ending Voiced vs. Unvoiced Consonants</h2><p>Tagged With: <a href="https://rachelsenglish.com/tag/comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comparison</a></p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how the ending Z sound in words like ‘flowers’ [flaˈʊ əɹz] sounds more like an S? Learn how to lighten certain endings to pronounce them easily and naturally.</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to talk about ending voiced vs. unvoiced consonants.</p>
<p>In American English, we have voiced and unvoiced sounds. All vowels are voiced. All diphthongs are voiced. Consonants can be either voiced or unvoiced. Unvoiced consonants are made just with air, no, uhh, sound from the vocal cords. For example, hh, sh, tt, pp. Voiced consonants do have voice in them, uhh, like: mm, bb, zh.</p>
<p>Hh, sh, tt, pp.<br>Mm, bb, zh.</p>
<p>There are lots of consonant pairs where the mouth position is the same, and one is voiced, the other is unvoiced, for example, CH / JJ.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, I’ll get a comment on a video asking about the pronunciation of these paired consonants at the end of a word. These come from people with a good ear that pay attention to what they hear. Mostly they say, I don’t hear a voiced consonant, I hear an unvoiced consonant. They’re right. We’re going to get into a topic here that is quite advanced. It deals with subtle differences of sound.</p>
<p>Let’s take, for example, the word ‘flowers’. In IPA, we spell that like this: the ending consonant is the Z sound, which is voiced. But actually, that kind of sounds like an S at the end, doesn’t it? Flowers, ss, ss. A really weak, light S. It doesn’t have a strong S, flowersss. That’s not correct. But it also doesn’t have a strong Z, flowerzzz. Flowers, ss, ss. It actually has a very weak S.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I was reading an old pronunciation book and it said how in these voiced/unvoiced pairs, the unvoiced is strong and the voiced is weak. I didn’t really know what that meant until I started thinking about ending consonants. These ending consonants are so weak that we take the voice out of them, and they end up sounding like weak unvoiced sounds. So the word is not flowerssss or flowerzzz but flowers, ss, ss, a weak unvoiced consonant.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a few more words.</p>
<p>Dive, ff, ff. It’s really a very weak F [f]. It’s not divvve or difffe, but dive, ff, ff.</p>
<p>Garage, sh, sh, sh. It’s a very weak unvoiced SH sound. It’s not garasshh or garazzhh, but, garage, sh, sh, sh.</p>
<p>Badge, ch, ch, ch. Very weak, unvoiced sound. Not batch, or baDGE, but badge, ch.</p>
<p>Weakening these ending voiced consonants can help you say the words more easily and more naturally.</p>
<p>Let’s study the word ‘badge’ a little further, and compare it with ‘batch’. Badge, batch. The ending of ‘badge’ is weak. Badge. The ending of ‘batch’ is stronger. ‘Batch’. That’s not the only difference. The unvoiced ending also makes the vowel a little bit shorter.</p>
<p>Badge, batch. They don’t sound quite the same. First of all, the ending of ‘batch’ is stronger. Badge, batch. CH, CH, instead of ch, ch. Also, the vowel is longer on the word ‘badge’. Vowels are a little longer before voiced endings in these kinds of minimal pairs. So, you have two clues to help figure out which word it is: the strength of the ending and the length of the vowel.</p>
<p>But, there is a time when the weak ending gets stronger. Do you know when that is? It’s when we link it to a word that begins with a vowel or diphthong. In a consonant to vowel link, it helps to think of the ending consonant as beginning the next word. So if you think of it as a beginning consonant, then it gets much stronger. Let’s go back to the word ‘flowers’, and put it in a phrase, ‘flowers on the table’. Flowers on, flowers on. Now I’m hearing a little bit more of a clear Z sound, zon [3x]. Flowers on. It’s stronger than when the word was at the end of a sentence. I love flowers. ss, ss, ss. Flowers on, zz, zz, zz. So if the ending, weak voiced consonant links into a vowel, it’s not really that weak anymore.</p>
<p>This topic was pretty advanced. So if you don’t understand, don’t worry. If you do, think of lightening ending voiced consonants and see if that helps make the pronunciation of those words easier.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Practice-Multi-Syllable-Words"><a href="#How-to-Practice-Multi-Syllable-Words" class="headerlink" title="How to Practice Multi-Syllable Words"></a>How to Practice Multi-Syllable Words</h2><p>Learn how to break long words up and practice by stress:  stressed syllables on their own, and unstressed syllables together.</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to go over how to work on long words.</p>
<p>Multi-syllable words can be really tricky. There are so many sounds and transitions in them. So today we’re going to talk about how to work on multi-syllable words.</p>
<p>I encourage you to keep a running list of long words that have come up in conversation for you that are hard for you to say. Maybe they are words that relate to your field of study or work.</p>
<p>Let’s use as an example the word ‘underestimate’. First, look it up in the dictionary and get the IPA. But what I really want to talk about today is, make sure you know what syllables are stressed. This is a five-syllable word with stress on the middle syllable. There is secondary stress in this word, marked by the little line at the bottom. I’m going to say, don’t worry about that. They’re more like unstressed syllables than stressed syllables.</p>
<p>Let’s start by just practicing the stressed syllable. Es. Do you know the shape of a stressed syllable? I made a video a long time ago about how the voice should curve up and then down in a stressed syllable. The sounds are the most important in this stressed syllable – they should be the clearest in your word. Practice just the stressed syllable using a hand movement, the shape is really important in making the word sound natural. Es, es. Maybe even try it in slow motion. Es.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the rest of the syllables. We have two before and two after. Practice these syllables together, there’s no need to practice them separately like the stressed syllable.</p>
<p>First we have ‘under’. These syllables should be really different than the stressed one, es. Under, under. What’s different? They’re a little quieter, less clear, they don’t have that shape. There’s less energy in the voice. Under – es – timate. Two more syllables, also unstressed. under-, -timate. There’s less mouth movement for these unstressed syllables, isn’t there? under-, -timate. They’re simpler. At the beginning of the video, I talked about how long words can be hard because there are so many sounds, but I want you to see that in unstressed syllables, the sounds don’t have to be fully formed and fully pronounced. These sounds are quieter, flatter in pitch, faster, simpler. under-, -timate. This should make long words easier, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to practice them. You do, you need repeat a new word over and over, but the point is to break it up into simplified and stressed syllables.</p>
<p>Let’s keep working on it: under – es –timate [2x]. Underestimate [3x].</p>
<p>Let’s try another word: inevitable. First, look up the stress. The second syllable is stressed, which we know because of the mark before it. So let’s break it down. Ev, ev, ev. In – ev – itable, -itable, -itable, -itable. In – ev – itable. Inevitable [3x].</p>
<p>Put together a list of long words and work through them this way. I really think that breaking up a word into stressed and unstressed syllables is the best way to master it, along with repetition. The more you get used to the contrast of stressed and unstressed syllables, the better. Stress really matters in American English.</p>

<h2 id="Tongue-Flexibility-and-the-N"><a href="#Tongue-Flexibility-and-the-N" class="headerlink" title="Tongue Flexibility and the N"></a>Tongue Flexibility and the N</h2><p>Tagged With: <a href="https://rachelsenglish.com/tag/exercises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exercises</a>, <a href="https://rachelsenglish.com/tag/tom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom</a></p>
<p>Practice relaxing the tongue when saying words and phrases with N.  Tom teaches you to train yourself to use the tongue and not the jaw when working with words and phrases with the N for more natural speech.</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to invite Tom to give you a practice tip on tongue flexibility.</p>
<p>Tom and I have been working together on Rachel’s English since 2012. He is a fantastic teacher and pronunciation coach. And I’ve invited him here today to give you a practice tip. Take it away, Tom!</p>
<p>Tongue flexibility is at the core of speaking English as clearly as possible. I notice with many of my students that when they need to use the N consonant, they will often use tension in the jaw to help out. Native speakers of English do not use tension to create these sounds – so, of course, using tension does create an “accent”.</p>
<p>This is an exercise I use in my lessons to practice tongue flexibility. Drop your jaw to an easy open position so that you can see clearly into your mouth when looking into a mirror or the camera on your laptop or phone. Then, reaching up just with the tip of the tongue, make the N consonant sound, nn, and drop the tongue back into a lower position in the mouth for an AH vowel, nah, nah. Do this three times slowly, nah, nah, nah. Now, try and speed up a little, without letting the jaw start moving up and down, keep the jaw relaxed and open. Nah, nah, nah. Then speed up and see how fast you can go. Nah, nah, nah, nahnahnah, etc.</p>
<p>We use this tongue flexibility in words like ‘another’ or ‘banana’. If I say those words with a tense jaw that has to move with my N consonant – the rhythm of my speech gets a little choppy. Instead, keep the jaw relaxed and let the tongue do the work. ‘Another’ ‘banana’, banana, another. This also helps the rhythm of your speech in phrases: ‘He’s on a TV show’, on a, He’s on a TV show. ‘a ton of fun’, a ton of, ton of, a ton of fun.</p>
<p>Notice, even at the end of the word ‘fun’, you can still let the tongue do the work and leave the jaw a bit more relaxed. Fun, -un, fun. Using your tongue in this more flexible way, and letting the jaw stay more relaxed as you speak, does great things for the rhythm of your speech, and, eventually, should lead to a more effortless way of speaking English.</p>
<p>Practice on your own with that lowered and relaxed jaw and begin building your tongue flexibility.</p>
<p>Tom, thank you so much. That was great. If you’re interested in working 1-on-1, I cannot recommend Tom enough. He is a world-class pronunciation coach. And, he still has room in his schedule for a few more students. So, if you’re interested, check out this page.</p>

<h2 id="SOFT-PALATE-EXERCISES-—-Vocal-Exercises"><a href="#SOFT-PALATE-EXERCISES-—-Vocal-Exercises" class="headerlink" title="SOFT PALATE EXERCISES — Vocal Exercises"></a>SOFT PALATE EXERCISES — Vocal Exercises</h2><p>Tagged With: <a href="https://rachelsenglish.com/tag/exercises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exercises</a></p>
<p>What exactly is the soft palate?  It is the soft part of the roof of your mouth.  When it’s lowered, it makes sounds nasal, like the NG sound in American English.  English has no nasal vowels, so having a lowered soft palate can affect the placement and sound of your speech.</p>
<p>As part of our series on relaxation and placement, this video talks about the soft palate.</p>
<p>An overall nasal sound can be caused either by tension in the throat, or by a lowered soft palate. When the soft palate is lowered, it allows some air to come through here, into the nasal cavity. That makes the voice live more in the face than in the body. Luckily there is a very easy way to tell if this is a problem for you. If you put your fingers on the bridge of your nose, you will feel it vibrate if your soft palate is lowered. Try it. Put your fingers here and say NN-AH. I feel a vibration for the N, which has a lowered soft palate, but not for the AH, which has a raised soft palate.</p>
<p>There are only three sounds in English that are nasal, with a lowered soft palate. They are N, M, and NG. Many other languages have nasal vowels,where the soft palate is down, including Mandarin, Polish, Hindi, French, and Portuguese. If your native language has nasal vowels, you’ll really want to pay attention to this.</p>
<p>First, test yourself. Let’s take the word ON. It has the AH as in FATHER vowel and the N consonant. Say it slowly, holding your nose. ON. Were you able to make the vowel with no vibration? Another word, SONG, has the AW as in LAW vowel followed by the NG consonant, song. Were you able to make the vowel with no vibration?</p>
<p>A lot of my students get concerned with the idea of raising and lowering the soft palate. It’s sort of hard to feel, and hard see. So I’ve told them just to focus on keeping it lifted. Somehow this does not interfere with the nasal consonants. I’ve never had a student fix their overall sound by keeping the soft palate raised, but then mess up their nasal consonants. So just focus on keeping it lifted.</p>
<p>How do you lift it. There are a few ways to get used to the feeling and the idea. One way to get used to feeling your soft palate is to suck through a straw. When you suck through a straw, your soft palate automatically closesto prevent the liquid from going up into your nasal cavity. So, see if you can feel it close. And if you can’t then try sucking up through the straw and holding it there. If you hold it, that might make you more aware of the feeling here, especially when you let go. See if you feel anything release. So go ahead, open a can of soda, treat yourself to that, and practice feeling your soft palate.</p>
<p>Another method that may help you lift your soft palate is to just think of creating more space back here. If you’re creating more space, you may automatically lift your soft palate to accommodate that. So you can focus on creating space in the back of your mouth or throat as you talk.</p>
<p>Another way to feel your soft palate is to watch yourself raising and lowering it. Switch back and forth between AH and NG. When you make the NG, of course, you’re lowering your palate. So switch back and forth between the two, and try to keep your tongue in the same position. That means it’s yoursoft palate that has to move. Watch yourself in a mirror. I’ll demonstrate now,so you should see what that looks like.</p>
<p>So, the soft palate: it’s hard to see and hard to feel, but it does play an important role in the placement of the voice in American English. Play around with these exercises, especially the last one, and see if you can get used to the idea of keeping your soft palate raised in all vowel sounds andmost consonant sounds in American English.</p>

<p>To achieve the low placement of American English, you have to speak with a relaxed body and face.  This video helps you release tension in the neck and throat.</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to go over neck and throat relaxation exercises.</p>
<p>When we help students find the UH sound, which we consider the core sound of American English, we often suggest finding a chest resonance, or a lower resonance, to help them find this sound.  The way to find that lower resonance is to relax your neck and throat, and connect the vibrations of your sound to your body.  Here are a few exercises to help relax your neck and throat and access that body connection.</p>
<p>First, let’s just relax the head down, chin to chest, and massage the back and sides of the neck.</p>
<p>>&gt; I can do that.</p>
<p>This should feel really good.</p>
<p>>&gt; Oh it does!</p>
<p>Feel free to give your shoulders some love.  You may also feel like sighing as you do this, a nice easy sound carried by easy breath.</p>
<p>>&gt; Great.</p>
<p>Now let’s roll our head around, starting slowly, just let your head hang down, with the chin on the chest, and start to gently roll it back and forth.  Just a little bit, don’t go too far. Stay slow, and then start rolling it up even further on each side. Then eventually, you can go around the whole circle.</p>
<p>>&gt; How’s that feel Tom?<br>>&gt; That feels really good.</p>
<p>Now as you go around the full circle, if you feel any spot that feels tense, that you feel a little bit of ache in as you go around, really focus on that. Maybe get in there with your fingers and rub that out, so that you can go ahead and free the neck all the way around.</p>
<p>Now drop one ear to your left shoulder, while you do this, gently reach your right hand towards the ground, you’ll feel a little stretch in the right side of your neck.  Don’t go too far, just do what feels good to release.  Then switch sides.</p>
<p>>&gt; How you doing there Tom?<br>>&gt; This is great!</p>
<p>Now, leading with your eyes, look over your left shoulder, as far as you can (but, of course, don’t hurt yourself!!), and switch.</p>
<p>Here’s one that may feel a little bit weird at first.  Let’s start with a very relaxed face, the jaw should be relaxed and possibly hanging open just a little bit.  Let’s just sigh, nice full breath in, and a relaxed sigh out. Let a little sound out with the sigh, let the vibrations from the sound relax the throat even more.  Now, put both hands on either side of your larynx, and very gently jiggle it back and forth.  As you do this, continue your easy breath in and easy sigh out.  If you’re able to do this, then it means your throat is relaxed because it’s impossible to do this with a lot of throat tension.</p>
<p>Lastly, let’s rub our hands together so they’re nice and warm and then place them around the neck.  A natural heating pad, though it cools down a little too quickly!</p>
<p>Now, with your newly relaxed neck and throat, sigh on AH and see if you can feel the vibration in the chest.  This relaxation will really come in handy as you work on your American English.</p>
<p>A lot of my students who speak with natural throat tension because of their native language have a hard time identifying the tension, because it’s so normal to them. So one way to work with this, to try to move your placement down is just to think of opening up the neck some. And all of these exercises will help. So go through all of these exercises, and then think of an opening sensation, so that your voice can rest more here. Any time there’s tension in the neck, it brings the placement up higher. But we want the American English placement to feel like it’s coming from here.</p>

<p>To achieve the low placement of American English, you have to speak with a relaxed body and face. This video helps you release tension in the tongue.</p>
<p>In this American English Pronunciation video, we’re going to go over tongue relaxation exercises.</p>
<p>From the L to the R to the T, the tongue is very important when it comes to articulation of all kinds of sounds. So having a relaxed tongue that can move quickly and efficiently is a very good thing.  Let’s learn how to relax this very strong muscle.</p>
<p>Just how strong is the tongue?  Very!  It’s considered the strongest muscle in the body in relation to it’s size.  One way to see how strong it is is to put your pinky finger to the roof of your mouth, then pin the pinky finger to the roof of the mouth with the tongue. Like that. Now, have a tongue vs. pinky war. If you’re like me, your tongue wins every time, and your pinky hurts.</p>
<p>So let’s relax this mega-muscle.</p>
<p>First, stick out your tongue (make sure you have clean hands for this), and massage your tongue.  Now this may feel weird, but it’s a good way to get to know this muscle that works so hard for us.</p>
<p>>&gt; I’ve never done that before.<br>>&gt; It’s strange. It’s a strange feeling. But actually, kind of feels good.</p>
<p>Now, stick your tongue out again, and this time, see if you can go from relaxed, to pointed, to relaxed, and back and forth, without tensing the rest of the face.  So.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, ok.<br>It’s hard to do it without tensing your lips.<br>Yeah.<br>You can get there eventually. But just to start, just begin exploring that ability.<br>Maybe give them a side-angle of that.<br>Sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright. At first, you may feel like you need to tense the lips and jaw to tense the tongue, but eventually, you’ll be able to isolate the tension to the tongue alone.</p>
<p>Then, keeping the tip of the tongue behind the front teeth, where it stays for almost all vowel sounds, do some tongue push ups, or push outs, to be more accurate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh. I’ve never seen that before.<br>So you’ll stick out the middle of the tongue, giving the tongue a good stretch.<br>Wow, you’re really good at that. Did you learn this in acting school?<br>I did.<br>Ok.<br>I spent a lot of time doing these exercises in school.<br>Let me try. It’s hard if you’re not used to it.<br>Yeah. It’s a little bit of a strange movement. But again, doing this will help you have a great relationship with all of what’s happening in your mouth, so that when you’re working with a teacher, or when you’re working with yourself, and you learn about where the tongue is supposed to be, it may become easier to do that new movement, or action with your tongue, because you’ve been able to have these exercises.<br>Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, one way to help yourself it so put your hand in front of your tongue and reach towards your hand. Give yourself a bit of a challenge.</p>
<p>>&gt; Oh wow.<br>>&gt; Now, I’ll never reach my hand, but it’s something to reach for.</p>
<p>Now, my least favorite exercise, bit a great one for the tongue.  We’re going to circle the tongue around the mouth in both directions.  Now, imagine that you’ve got peanut butter stuck on your gums, and you’re going to circle the tongue around trying to get the peanut butter out.</p>
<p>>&gt; I kind of like that one.<br>>&gt; Yeah?<br>>&gt; Yeah. Why is that your least favorite?<br>>&gt; Because when you do it 10 times one way and 10 times the other way, you, your tongue starts to really get sore. So work up to ten times one way, and then switch to ten times the other way.  But you can start with 5.</p>
<p>Now, drop your head, relax the tongue out of the mouth, and shake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh boy. Do I have to try that?<br>Give it a shot.<br>Ok. I better hold my hair.<br>Perfect. Such relaxation.<br>Yep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, you should feel the tongue release all the way in the back of the mouth.  And as you do this, some saliva may fly around. And if so, congratulations. You’re doing it perfectly.</p>
<p>Now, let’s practice some articulation with this newly relaxed tongue.</p>
<p>So, that’s using the unvoiced T sound. Now let’s try the voiced D sound.</p>
<p>And you can just feel the very tip of your tongue on the gum ridge there for that nice, light touch. Efficient T and D. Let’s try.</p>
<p>And then, some fun practice. Trumpet players call this “double tonguing”. It’s to articulate the tongue in the front, with the tip of the tongue for the T, and then a K sound with the back.</p>
<p>>&gt; Oh wow. When you do that you just feel your tongue going back and forth.<br>>&gt; Yeah, it’s really fun.<br>>&gt; That’s kind of cool.</p>
<p>Alright, nice job. Remember, this is a great way to get to know your tongue, and may be really helpful when it comes to dealing with complicated consonant clusters that involve the tongue in words like: strike, plurals, and twelfth. Those are tough ones.</p>
<p>Some of my students have a hard time moving their tongue without moving their jaw. So, as you do some of these exercises, make sure you do some holding the jaw firm, so that the tongue is moving independently, like this.</p>
<p>You should be able to do it without moving the jaw at all. If you’re having a hard time, try holding on to the jaw lightly to really focus your effort on the tongue.</p>

<p>To achieve the low placement of American English, you have to speak with a relaxed body and face.  This video helps you release tension in the jaw.</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to go over jaw relaxation.</p>
<p>Hello and Welcome to Rachel’s English.  Today, we’re going to talk about ways to relax the jaw.<br>>&gt; Ow.<br>>&gt; Yeah, that looked painful!<br>>&gt; Yeah. That was painful.</p>
<p>Many of our students have a tendency to hold a bunch of tension in the jaw, whether as a habit from their native language, or because they are focusing on learning a bunch of new sounds.  In American English, we want a relaxed face and throat, and body if possible.  But today, we’re going to focus on relaxing the jaw.  Here are a few exercises you can use before you practice or in the middle of your practice when you feel tension creeping in.</p>
<p>First off, you may have heard from teachers in the past that you need to drop your jaw more.  More Jaw Drop!!  This instruction can create tension as you work on vowel and diphthong sounds that need a bunch of space – like AH, AW, and AI, and others.  Instead of thinking about using your muscles to hold the jaw open, which can add tension to the face, think of releasing the jaw.  Let the jaw drop down using gravity, rather than muscle.</p>
<p>If you put your fingers just under your ears and open and close your mouth, you’ll feel movement of the jaw bone, we’ll call this spot the “jaw hinge”.  Think of releasing your jaw from back here, rather than forcing the chin down.  By doing this, we lose the tension that can affect the sound, and we have a fuller more open sound.  We’ll come back to the hinge.  But first, let’s start some jaw relaxation exercises.</p>
<p>Let’s start by just easily massaging the jaw with your fingertips.  As you begin freeing the jaw, you may start to yawn more – awesome!  Keep yawning!  It’s a great stretch and provides you with wonderful deep breaths that encourage support. When you yawn, make sure you yawn both vertically and horizontally. Really get a great stretch for the jaw, and the lips actually for that one.</p>
<p>Now, using the heel of your hand, drag the hand down the jaw bone on the face towards your chin, really thinking about releasing that jaw hinge and letting the face muscles relax.</p>
<p>>&gt; I look silly. But it is relaxing.<br>>&gt; Totally ok to look silly. It’s great, actually.<br>>&gt; Oh, that feels so good.</p>
<p>Now, let’s go back to that hinge we spoke about earlier, back here.  Allow your newly relaxed jaw to release down for a moment and feel that space that opens up under your ear as the hinge releases down.  This is a great pressure point on our face, by pressing in to it we can release the jaw even more.  Now, this can feel quite painful, so don’t hurt yourself, but it will feel great when you let go!</p>
<p>Now, take your chin between thumb and index finger and move the jaw up and down.</p>
<p>>&gt; Whoa. Oh, that’s hard.<br>>&gt; Don’t hurt yourself on this one, either.<br>>&gt; You gotta watch your tongue!<br>>&gt; It can be very difficult! Yeah, make sure your tongue’s not in the way.</p>
<p>Really let your hand control your jaw, you’ll feel the jaw kind of want to fight back a little bit. See if you can relax it, and just let your hand be in control.</p>
<p>>&gt; Yeah, my jaw definitely does not want to give up control.<br>>&gt; Yeah. So, lots, lots to work on.</p>
<p>Now, if you haven’t felt silly already, prepare to. And if you’re really relaxed, prepare to let a little saliva fly around.  Now, clasp your hands together and shake your body and face, keeping that jaw released.</p>
<p>>&gt; I don’t know if I’m willing to do that on camera.<br>>&gt; Come on Rachel.<br>>&gt; Ok. Do it again?</p>
<p>Let’s use this newly released jaw a bit and practice on some vowel sounds, some vowel sounds that use some jaw drop. So AH and AW. Now, let’s go from OO, which has a tight lip rounding here, OO, and move into AW</p>
<p>OO-AW, OO-AW</p>
<p>Now, let’s move from OO into AH: OO-AH, OO-AW</p>
<p>You can practice going back and forth, and this may help you hear the difference between those two sounds.</p>
<p>All right!  Hopefully your jaw feels more relaxed.  Remember to do this whenever you feel tension creep in as you practice and drill, and when you’re having trouble finding the difference between vowel sounds. It may just be that you want more space – and the best way to create space – is to release that jaw!</p>

<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
<h2 id="The-Path-of-the-Voice"><a href="#The-Path-of-the-Voice" class="headerlink" title="The Path of the Voice"></a>The Path of the Voice</h2><p>Knowing how the voice works will help advance your ideas and knowledge about placement. Think about this as you try to sound more American.  Placement makes a big difference</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to study the path of the voice and placement.</p>
<p>One of the things I often talk about with my students is placement.  I sometimes feel like their voice only comes from their head, and is placed very much so here, whereas my voice, when I speak English, rests more here.  And I feel the placement a little lower.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a little bit about what happens when you’re speaking.  So, the diaphragm, here, an involuntary muscle, just like you’re heart, tenses up, which pulls down a little bit.  That turns your lungs into a vacuum, and it sucks the air in.  When your diaphragm relaxes, the air then comes out.  Your vocal cords here are what make the sound.  Think of blowing up a balloon, and taking the neck of it, pulling it wide so it makes that annoying squeak sound.  That’s what your vocal cords are.  So, your lungs are the balloon, and your vocal cords are the mouth of the balloon.  And this pressure here is the energy of the voice.</p>
<p>So this is the energy, the fuel of the voice, and up here we have the articulators:  the tongue, the teeth, the jaw.  That takes the core sound made by the vocal cords, and shapes them into the sounds of American English.</p>
<p>I feel like many of my students lack a connection to this fuel, to the energy.  And they speak only from their face.  Of course their body works in the same way, they’re bringing in the air, but they seem to have no attachment to it.  And their voice seems completely detached from their bodies.  But when I speak, I feel my voice very attached to my body.</p>
<p>One exercise you can do to try to focus on your body rather than your face when you’re speaking, is just to exaggerate the movement here, tss, tss, of your abdoment, tss, zz, tss, zz, to connect more to a lower sensation of the breath.  Now you wouldn’t want to do that when you’re speaking, but it could be a good exercise for you, to get you into your body.</p>
<p>So here we have the fuel and here the articulation.  Now, we want our articulators to be very relaxed.  If there’s any tension, in the throat, for example, it will bring the voice up, and the placement up, and then we loose the connection here to the fuel of the voice, to the body.</p>
<p>We’re currently working on a series of videos dealing with relaxation to help you get the voice out of your face and head and into your body.  In the mean time, just play around with the idea of pulling the air all the way down, ss, zz, and fueling your voice from here, a lower spot in your body.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

<h2 id="English-A-Stress-Timed-Language"><a href="#English-A-Stress-Timed-Language" class="headerlink" title="English: A Stress-Timed Language"></a>English: A Stress-Timed Language</h2><p>In some languages, every syllable is the same length. In English, it sounds very awkward to make each syllable the same length.  It’s important to have contrast, some long and some short syllables.</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to go over why some words sound different when they’re said on their own than they do when they’re said as part of a sentence, like ‘for’, ‘fer’.</p>
<p>A lot of people think, when they’re studying a language and they’re new to it, that they need to pronounce each word fully and clearly in order to be well-understood.  But in English that’s actually not the case.  English is a stress-timed language.  That means some syllables will be longer, and some will be shorter.  Many languages, however, are syllable-timed, which means each syllable has the same length.  Examples of syllable-timed languages:  French, Spanish, Cantonese.  So, when an American hears a sentence of English, with each syllable having the same length, it takes just a little bit longer to get the meaning.  This is because we are used to stressed syllables, syllables that will pop out of the line because they’re longer and they have more shape.  Our ears, our brains, go straight to those words.  Those are the content words.  When all syllables are the same length, then there’s no way for the ear to know which words are the most important.</p>
<p>So this is why stress is so important in American English.  It’s a stress-timed language.  When you give us nice shape in your stressed syllables, you’re giving us the meaning of the sentence.  This means that other syllables need to be unstressed — flatter, quicker — so that the stressed syllables are what the ear goes to.  This is why it’s so important to reduce function words that can reduce in American English.  When those function words are part of a whole, part of a sentence, they are pronounced differently.  Let’s look at some examples.</p>
<p>—-.  Do you know what I’m saying?  A native speaker might not either.  But, in the context of a sentence, “I’m going to the store,” a native speaker would know exactly what I was saying.  I’m going to the store.  I’m going to the store.  When ‘to the’ is pronounced —- (reduced and linked), ‘going’ and ‘store’ become the obvious words in that sentence.  I’m going to the store.</p>
<p>What about —-?  Can you understand what I’m saying?  A native speaker might not either.  But, in the sentence fragment “Because of my job,” “Because of my job,” a native speaker would know exactly what I was saying.  Because of my job.  Because of my job.  ‘Because’ and ‘of’ are so unstressed, so reduced and low in pitch, that the word ‘job’ is able to really jump out of the sentence.  Because of my job.</p>
<p>This is really of primary importance in American English pronunciation.  As you’re working on pronunciation, keep in mind this idea of a word being part of a whole.</p>
<p>The word ‘for’:  part of a word becomes fer, fer, fer you, fer me, fer dinner.  Practice it this way.  Drill it over and over.  Other words that can reduce:  ‘and’ can become ‘n’.  ‘Them’ can become ‘thum’ or ’em’.  ‘At’ can become ‘ut’.  ‘To’ can become ‘tuh’ or ‘duh’.  ‘Can’ can become ‘kun’, ‘kun’.  ‘Are’ can become ‘er’, ‘er’.  ‘Was’ can become ‘wuz’, ‘wuz’.  ‘That’ can become ‘thut’, ‘thut’.  ‘Your’ can become ‘yer’, ‘yer’.  ‘At the’ can become ‘ut the’, ‘ut the’.  And so on.  So keep an eye out for this as you’re studying pronunciation and listening to native speakers.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
<p>I’m excited to announce that I’m running another online course, so do check out my website for details.  You’ll find on there all sorts of information about the course, who should take the course, and requirements.  I really hope you’ll check it out and consider signing up.  I’ve had a blast with my first online course, and I’m looking forward to getting to know you.</p>
<p>Don’t stop there.  Have fun with my real-life English videos.  Or get more comfortable with the IPA in this play list.  Learn about the online courses I offer, or check out my latest video.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Pronounce-Any-Word"><a href="#How-to-Pronounce-Any-Word" class="headerlink" title="How to Pronounce Any Word"></a>How to Pronounce Any Word</h2><p>I’ve made a lot of videos that go over how to pronounce specific words, but I can’t make a video for every word.  This video shows you resources that already exist on the internet to help you pronounce any word.</p>
<p>I often get emails from users asking how to pronounce specific words. Today I’m going to show you three different online resources that will help you figure this out on your own. First, dictionary.com. Let’s use the word ‘attain’.The default on dictionary.com is their own pronunciation guide. But you can see the link here, show IPA, and when you click it, it brings up the international phonetic alphabet transcription of the word — the same pronunciation symbols that my website uses. So you can see here, ‘attain’ begins with the unaccented schwa syllable. This little mark means that the next syllable is stressed. So the stressed syllable begins with the T consonant, has the ‘ay’ as in ‘say’ diphthong, and the N consonant. Whenyou press the speaker icon, you can hear a short audio clip of a native speaker saying the word. Attain.The next site I want to show you is the Cambridge Dictionary of American English. So again, we’ll look up the word ‘attain’. Here you see the IPA transcription of the word. And again, there’s a speaker icon, where you can hear a different native speaker saying the word. Attain. So, in both of these great resources, you can hear the word pronounced by a native speaker, but you can also see the International Phonetic Alphabet transcription of the word.</p>
<p>And here’s a site called howjsay.com. Again, we’ll look at the word ‘attain’. Attain. There’s no transcription here, but again you get a third opportunity to hear a different person saying the word. To hear the word a second time,just move the cursor over the word again. Attain. The default pronunciation for this site is British English. But for some words they will give you both British English and American English. For example, on the word ‘water’. Water, American, water. One thing I really like about this site is that you can type multiple words separated by a semicolon to bring them up in one batch.Then you can move quickly from audio file to audio file. This will help you if you have multiple words that sound the same to you — if you’re not quite sure how to differentiate the words. Seen, sing. I encourage you to take advantage of these wonderful free resources on the web as you work on your pronunciation. That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
<h2 id="Mouth-Position-Study"><a href="#Mouth-Position-Study" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Position Study"></a>Mouth Position Study</h2><p>Tagged With: <a href="https://rachelsenglish.com/tag/test-yourself/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Test Yourself</a></p>
<p>The mouth positions define the sounds.  Can you guess the sound by looking at the shape of the mouth?</p>
<p>In this video, we’re going to focus on the correct mouth position for the various sounds in American English.</p>
<p>Today we’re going to look at freeze frames of the mouth in various different positions, and we’ll guess what sound is being produced. It’s important to know well the positions of the different sounds. The correct position is the key to the correct pronunciation. Let’s get started.</p>
<p>What sound do you think is being made here? The lips are closed, but clearly the mouth is not at rest. This is the M sound, where the lips are closed but the vocal cords make noise. M isn’t the only sound that is made with closed lips. B and P are also made by releasing closed lips. This is the B sound, bb. What sound do you think we have here? Corners of the lips are pulled back, and the top lip is a little raised, showing some of the top teeth.You can see that the tongue is coming down in the front, touching behind the bottom front teeth. And it’s raised in the back, because we can see quite a bit of the tongue. This is the AA vowel, aa. Notice how much the jaw is dropped for this sound. And what sound is being made here? The bottom lip has been pulled up and is touching the bottom of the top front teeth. That means it is either the F or the V sound. In this case, it was the V. But both the F and the V take this same position. What sound is this? The lips are flared, and the teeth are together. There are actually four sounds that have this mouth position: SH, DJ, CH, and JJ. Here, I was saying the word ‘generally’, so it was the JJ sound. What sound is this? The tongue is coming through the teeth. If you guessed the TH, you’re correct. This can either be the voiced or the unvoiced TH. The L can also have this shape. Some people do bring the tongue tip to the bottom of the front teeth, rather than to the hard palate to make the L sound. What sound is this? The lips are making a tight circle. This is the W consonant sound. What sound is this? The lips are parted, but the teeth are together. In this particular photo, it is the Z sound, zz, in the word ‘because’. It’s the same mouth position as the S sound. The true T and D sounds are also made in part by the teeth being together with the lips parted. The sound is made complete when the teeth part and the air comes out. What sound is this? The lips have come in,yet it looks a little less round than the W. This is a beginning R, in the word ‘reduce’. If you could see it from the side, you would see that as the corners have come in, the lips do come away from the face as they round.</p>
<p>In closing, we are going to watch speech with the sound turned off. This is to help you focus on the mouth. I want you to see how much the mouth really is moving to make these different sounds. When you practice English, use a mirror sometimes, and watch your mouth. Make sure that your lips rrrrrrrround enough to make the R sound, and that your tongue comes th-th-th-through the teeth for the TH. Let’s watch.</p>

<p>What is the difference between voiced consonants and unvoiced consonants?  For voiced consonants, the vocal cords are engaged, making sound.  For unvoiced consonants, the vocal cords are not making sound, there is just air passing through them.</p>
<p>Voiced and unvoiced consonants. Many consonants in English are paired together because one is the unvoiced version of the other. They take the same mouth position, and the same tongue position. But in one of them, you just go ‘hhh,’ passing air. In the other one, you actually make a sound: uh, uh. For example: ch, ch. Only air is coming through my teeth. Jj, jj: I’m making an ‘uh, uh’ sound here. Within the pairs, the unvoiced sounds are: tt, ff, pp, kk, th, ss, sh, ch. The voiced sounds of those are: dd, vv, bb, gg, th, zz, dj, jj. And in the consonants that have no pair, there is only one that is unvoiced. And that is the hh as in ‘hi.’ The others are all voiced. mm, nn, ng, ll, rr, yy, ww.</p>

<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to focus on placement in American English.</p>
<p>>&gt; Did you get a chance to look over those transcripts?<br>>&gt; I did. Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it.<br>>&gt; No problem.</p>
<p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to focus on placement in American English.   Topic:  Transcripts.</p>
<p>This video is a placement exercise, and it’s going to get a little weird.</p>
<p>>&gt; The fun thing about this is we’re totally playing with language.<br>>&gt; Yeah.<br>>&gt; I mean like, this is cracking us up.<br>>&gt; Absolutely, yeah!</p>
<p>But stick with me.  Placement refers to where in your body the vibrations of your voice are happening.  Sometimes the difference in the sound of the voice is subtle, and sometimes more obvious.  I’m going to say a phrase with three different placements:</p>
<p>That’s so weird.</p>
<p>That’s so weird.</p>
<p>That’s so weird.</p>
<p>That’s so weird.</p>
<p>That’s so weird.</p>
<p>For American English, I always try to get my students to bring the resonance down.  Very low, very relaxed.  Uhhhh is the feeling of placement I want them to imitate.  Uhhh….</p>
<p>In this video, Tom and I are going to have a short conversation.  Then we’ll go back over it, phrase by phrase, and copy the intonation, but just on uh.  This seems silly, but it is literally something we do with our students to bring the focus to placement.  When you take out the actual words, it’s easier to focus on placement and other qualities of the voice.  Do it out loud with us.  The sound we’re using is the UH as in BUTTER vowel. Everything in the mouth and face is relaxed. Uhhh—uhhh.</p>
<p>First, the conversation.</p>
<p>>&gt; Did you get a chance to look over those transcripts?</p>
<p>>&gt; I did. Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>>&gt; No problem.</p>
<p>>&gt; How long did it take?</p>
<p>>&gt; About 10 hours altogether.</p>
<p>>&gt; Okay, that’s not bad.</p>
<p>>&gt; It was fine.</p>
<p>Now we’ll hear the conversation, phrase by phrase.  We’ll listen to each phrase, and repeat it back with the same placement and intonation, but on the sound ‘uh’.  This first time through, just listen.</p>
<p>Did you get a chance to look over those transcripts?</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uh</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>How long did it take?</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh uhh- uhh?</p>
<p>About 10 hours altogether.</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh</p>
<p>That’s not bad.</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh-</p>
<p>It was fine.<br>Uhh- uhh- uhh-</p>
<p>Now we’ll hear the conversation phrase by phrase, with the UH imitation three times.  Repeat the third time, just on UH, copying what you hear.  Think about everything in the face and neck being relaxed, and the placement low.  Maybe even put your hand here.  Uhhh—</p>
<p>Did you get a chance to look over those transcripts?</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh?</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh?</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>How long did it take?</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh uhh- uhh?</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh uhh- uhh?</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh uhh- uhh?</p>
<p>About 10 hours altogether.</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh</p>
<p>That’s not bad.</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh-</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh-</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh-</p>
<p>It was fine.<br>Uhh- uhh- uhh-</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh-</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh-</p>
<p>Now we’ll put the text back in.  But, to stay focused on the placement, we’re going to slow the speech down.</p>
<p>>&gt; Did you get a chance to look over those transcripts?</p>
<p>>&gt; I did. Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>>&gt; No problem.</p>
<p>>&gt; How long did it take?</p>
<p>>&gt; About 10 hours altogether.</p>
<p>>&gt; Okay, that’s not bad.</p>
<p>>&gt; It was fine.</p>
<p>We want to the words to grow out of that same, low placement.  You’ll hear the UH phrase once at regular pace, then slowed down, then the actual phrase slowed down.  Then, repeat with me and Tom, slowed down, [slow motion] keeping the placement low.</p>
<p>We’re almost there.  Now we’ll hear the UH phrase once a regular pace.  Repeat it at regular pace.  Then we’ll hear the phrase at regular pace, repeat it at regular pace.</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh?</p>
<p>Uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh- uhh?</p>

<p>You’ve seen the letter X, but did you know there’s no X sound in American English? Confusing, right? In this video, you’re going to learn the different sounds we use to pronounce the letter X. So you’ll feel totally comfortable pronouncing words with this letter.  </p>
<p>Every once in a while, I get a question from someone about the X sound. And I have to say, there is no X sound in American English. We have the letter X but let’s take a look at what sounds that letter actually represents.  </p>
<p>There are four different ways this letter can be pronounced. First, we’ll go over those pronunciations, then we’ll go over the most common words with the letter X and which pronunciation those words have.  </p>
<p>First, let’s go over the two most common pronunciations. In each of these words, the letter X makes two different sounds. The word extra. Before I tell you what sounds are there, I want you to listen and see if you can guess. Extra. Extra. Now, I’m going to slow it down and exaggerate. Extra. Extra. Extra. Extra. Kkk. Ssss. K and S. That’s the unvoiced version of this pronunciation. Extra.  </p>
<p>Now we don’t pronounce them with the separation. K is a stop consonant, ek- ek-. Did you hear how my voice abruptly stopped? Ek– It wasn’t ehh– That’s because of the K. You lift the back of the tongue to the soft palate. Ekk– And that cuts off of the air, it cuts off the sound. Now, rather than pulling down the tongue by itself, ekk– kk– kk– Rather than making that full K sound, you instead go right into the S. Ekk– sss— ksss— </p>
<p>So when you pull your tongue down in the back, the front of your tongue, the front of your mouth is already in position for the S sound. Ekkkksss— So when you release the air, release the tongue, everything’s ready to go for the S and the S sound is made.  </p>
<p>For the S, the teeth are together and the tip of the tongue is either pressing the back of the bottom front teeth, or it can point up a little bit. Sssss. Sssss. Practice just the KS sounds with me. Front of the mouth is in position for the S, and bring the back of the tongue up to the soft palate. Let air build up and release it by bringing the back of the tongue down.  </p>
<p>Kksss. Kksss. Kksss. Kksss. Kksss. Kksss. Let’s put it into the word ‘extra’ slowly. Extra. Extra. That’s the unvoiced pronunciation.  </p>
<p>But there’s also a voiced pronunciation like in the word ‘exam’. The letter X still represents two sounds here. What sounds are you hearing now? Exam. I’ll pronounce it slowly. Eeggggg– zzz– eggzzaam.  </p>
<p>G and Z. Those are the voice versions of K and S so everything about the position is the same, but rather than releasing air, ksss, ksss, you release a voiced sound, gzz, gzzz, gzzz. Exam. Exam.  </p>
<p>You know what I find interesting about these two pronunciations is that there’s a syllable break between the two sounds that this one letter X makes. Exam. Exam. So the Z sound starts the stressed syllable. Exam.   </p>
<p>The word ‘except’. The S sound starts the stressed syllable. Except. Okay, so those are the two most common pronunciations. What are the other two pronunciations of the letter X?  </p>
<p>It can be a Z sound. This happens in two cases. First, when it starts a word. Two examples: Xanthan. You may know this word because it’s a common ingredient in processed foods. Xanthan. Z sound. Xenophile. Someone who loves foreign cultures, people, or customs. Z sound. Xenophile. This is X at the beginning of a word.  </p>
<p>At the end of a word, it can also be a Z sound. These are words that we’ve borrowed from French. The combination EAUX and we may keep the French spelling with the X at the end but we use the American pronunciation. They’re plurals so we add a Z sound. For example, the word ‘beau’. A sweetheart, a male sweetheart. Maybe you have lots of Beau’s. For the spelling of the plural, we may write an S or we may write an X. Both are acceptable in American English. But both are pronounced with the American English rules which is a Z sound at the end. It can be a little confusing.   </p>
<p>It can also be silent at the end of a few words. I’m thinking of the word ‘faux’ which is another way of saying fake. My coat is faux fur not real fur. Also in the word ‘Bordeaux’ where we kind of use the French pronunciation. Also in ‘roux’ again, a word borrowed from French, a mixture of fat and flour to thicken sauces. Faux. Bordeaux. Roux. The letter X is silent.  </p>
<p>But the most common pronunciations of the letter X are KS or GZ. I’ve gathered some words for each category and I found something interesting. Something interesting happens with the word ‘sex’ which, let’s face, it is an interesting word anyway. So we’ll go over that when we get to it. But first, I need your help. Almost every example I came up with where the sound is voiced, GZ looks the same. EX and then the rest of the word. I can’t tell if I can’t think of any more because I’m so focused on that or if there just aren’t many more.    </p>
<p>So please put any words you can think of where the letter X makes the GZ sounds in the comments below.   </p>
<p>Here’s my list. Repeat out loud and remember, in each word, X is GZ. Gzzz. Gzz.   </p>
<p>Alexander </p>
<p>Exact </p>
<p>Exactly </p>
<p>Exalt </p>
<p>Exam </p>
<p>Examine </p>
<p>Example </p>
<p>Executive </p>
<p>Exert </p>
<p>Exhibit </p>
<p>Exile </p>
<p>Exist </p>
<p>Existence </p>
<p>Exit </p>
<p>Exude  </p>
<p>Now for words where the letter X makes the unvoiced sounds, KS, kssss. We’ll talk about sex when we get to it in this list.   </p>

<p>Saxophone </p>
<p>Sex  </p>
<p>Okay, let’s listen.   </p>
<p>Sex </p>
<p>Sexy </p>
<p>Sexist </p>
<p>Sexual </p>
<p>Sexuality  </p>
<p>So with the word ‘sex’. Something changes when it’s followed by U, like in: sexual, sexuality, bisexual, sexualized. Now, instead of KS, the sounds we get are KSH. Ksshh. Kkk-sshh.   </p>
<p>Sexual. So sex, sexy, we still have KS. But as soon as it’s followed by U, sexual, sexual. It changes. We now have KSH. Sexual. And actually, I thought of one other word. The word ‘luxury’ this is also different. It’s just like ‘sexual’ only it’s voiced, so it’s G and then ddjjzz. Lugg– there’s the G, lugggjjzz, gggjjzz, gggjjzz, gggjjzz and there’s the gggjjzz sound. Luxury. Luxury.   </p>
<p>I couldn’t come up with any other words with this pronunciation. If you can think of any words where the letter X makes the ggjjzz sounds, definitely put those words in the comments below.   </p>
<p>You’ve learned a lot about the letter X today and also about English. You’ve learned that in English, any one letter can be pronounced various different ways. And you can’t necessarily tell by looking at it. This is why phonetics are so important. Understanding the symbols we use for sounds rather than trying to think in terms of letters.   </p>
<p>How familiar are you with the International Phonetic Alphabet? I’ve made a series of videos that goes over the symbols you need to know for American English, and this can be really helpful when looking up a word and trying to figure out the pronunciation.  </p>
<p>Click here now or in the description below to start learning these important symbols. What other words can you think of with an X and what pronunciation does the letter X have in those words? Put them in the comments below so everyone can learn even more words with the letter X. That’s it and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed, when you’re on the phone, that you often need to spell things out?  Your name, for example, or maybe the name of the street you live on.  Letter names, over the phone can be unclear and hard to distinguish, and not just for non-native speakers.  So, there is a specific set of words corresponding to each letter of the alphabet to make spelling over the phone much easier.   Today we’ll learn this set of words.</p>
<p>Smith is the most common last name in the United States.  It’s my last name.  But even though it’s so common, often, over the phone, people don’t understand me.  Why?  I think it’s because unvoiced sounds like SS and TH don’t carry well over the phone.</p>
<p>And we have so many letter names that rhyme:  B, C, D, E, G, P, T, V, Z, or A, J, K, or I, W</p>
<p>Or sound similar:  M, N, or F, S, X</p>
<p>So many misunderstandings can happen when spelling.  A system was developed in the 1950s by the International Civil Aviation Organization to put a word with each letter.  Apparently the letters were chosen for understandability based on hundreds of thousands of comprehension tests involving 31 nationalities.  So no matter what your accent is, you’ll probably be understood using this alphabet system.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<p>A as in Alpha. Alpha.</p>
<p>B as in Bravo. Bravo.</p>
<p>C as in Charlie. Charlie.</p>
<p>D as in Delta. Delta.</p>
<p>E as in Echo. Echo.</p>
<p>F as in Foxtrot. Foxtrot.</p>
<p>G as in Golf. Golf.</p>
<p>H as in Hotel. Hotel.</p>
<p>I as in India. India.</p>
<p>J as in Juliet.Juliet.</p>
<p>K as in Kilo. Kilo.</p>
<p>L as in Lima. Lima.</p>
<p>M as in Mike. Mike.</p>
<p>N as in November. November.</p>
<p>O as in Oscar. Oscar.</p>
<p>P as in Papa. Papa.</p>
<p>Q as in Quebec. Quebec.</p>
<p>R as in Romeo. Romeo.</p>
<p>S as in Sierra. Sierra.</p>
<p>T as in Tango. Tango.</p>
<p>U as in Uniform. Uniform.</p>
<p>V as in Victor. Victor.</p>
<p>W as in Whiskey. Whiskey.</p>
<p>X as in X-ray. X-ray.</p>
<p>Y as in Yankee. Yankee.</p>
<p>Z as in Zulu. Zulu.</p>
<p>So if someone asks you to spell your name, you can say:  R as in Romeo, A as in Alpha, C as in Charlie, H as in Hotel, E as in Echo, L as in Lima.  Or you can just say the word:  Romeo, Alpha, Charlie, Hotel, Echo, Lima.</p>
<p>Just the other day, I found myself needing to give a confirmation number over the phone.  I was in the process of making this video, but I hadn’t yet memorized all of the right letter names.  Sure.  W as in West.  I as in Innocent.  I messed up the target words.  Couldn’t remember them all.  I’ll have to study my video.  Luckily, by the time I had to give another confirmation number, I had looked them up.  Sure.  It’s Y as in Yankee, U as in Uniform, L as in Lima, P as in Papa, C as in Charlie, X as in X-ray.</p>

<h2 id="Why-we-need-the-IPA"><a href="#Why-we-need-the-IPA" class="headerlink" title="Why we need the IPA"></a>Why we need the IPA</h2><p>In this American English Pronunciation video, we’re going to go over why we need the IPA. This video was created for a course on IPA that is part of the Rachel’s English Academy, but I thought it was worth sharing here.</p>
<p>Rachel’s English Academy is a collection of courses I’ve created to help you speak better English. Courses on everything you need to know about pronunciation, listening comprehension, conversation courses, phrasal verbs, and so on.  You can join the Rachel’s English Academy here for a small monthly fee. Once you join, you’re locked in to that price for life even if the price goes up. Okay, without further ado, the lesson.</p>
<p>The International Phonetic Alphabet was created by the International Phonetic Association as a standardized way to write the sounds of spoken language.  Why do we need this?  Because English is not a phonetic language — that means there’s not a 1:1 relationship between letters and sounds.  For example, these words:</p>
<p>They look the same except for the first letter.  They look like they should be pronounced the same except for the first sound.  But that’s not the case.  ‘Love’ has the UH as in BUTTER vowel.  ‘Cove’ has the OH diphthong, and ‘move’ has the OO vowel.  Uh, oh, oo.  Love, cove, move.  There are no rules to tell you which word should be pronounced which way, you just have to know.  You just have to learn the pronunciation when you learn the word.</p>
<p>Let’s go a little further.  What about this word?  It looks like the other three words, and its pronunciation is ‘dove’, just like ‘love’.  Wait, no.  Its pronunciation is ‘dove’, just like ‘cove’.  Actually, both pronunciations are right.  For the noun, the bird, it’s ‘dove’.  UH. But for the verb, past tense of ‘dive’, it’s pronounced ‘dove’.  So again, we need IPA to write these different sounds so we can see that words are spelled the same, may still be pronounced differently.  This is called a HET-er-uh-nim.  heteronym.</p>
<p>One more confusing point:  homophones.  Words that are spelled differently, but pronounced the same.  For example, pear.  Just one pronunciation for these two words:  pear, pare.  There are lots of homophones in American English.  So we need the IPA to see, oh, they’re spelled differently, but they’re pronounced the same.</p>
<p>When you write a sound, in IPA, with a symbol instead of a letter, there’s no confusion.  You’re going to see a lot of IPA in the Rachel’s English Academy, so this course is to help you get used to these symbols, to help you start to recognize them.</p>

<h2 id="Learn-the-IPA-—-Consonants"><a href="#Learn-the-IPA-—-Consonants" class="headerlink" title="Learn the IPA — Consonants"></a>Learn the IPA — Consonants</h2><p>Let’s take a look at the letter T.  It can be silent, like in the word ‘fasten’, it can be pronounced CH, ch, as in the word ‘future’.  It can be pronounced tt like in the word ‘tap’.  When paired with the H, it can be th, the unvoiced TH, as in the word ‘thanks’.  Or it can be th, the voiced TH, as in the word ‘this’.  The letter T can actually represent various sounds.  This is why the International Phonetic Alphabet makes it easier to study the pronunciation of foreign languages.  This video focuses on consonants.</p>
<p>What is the International Phonetic Alphabet?  It’s a system of phonetic notation, and I use it a lot on my website and when I teach students.  I’ve also used it a lot when I’ve studied foreign languages.  The IPA is especially  handy when studying English because English is not a phonetic language.  This means when you see a letter or a group of letters, it will not necessarily be pronounced the same in each word in which it occurs, just as in the example at the beginning of this video.</p>
<p>The IPA has a written symbol for each phonetic sound.  So, this makes it easier to read about and write about pronunciation.  As a student of pronunciation, it’s important that you become familiar with the symbols that represent the sounds of American English.</p>
<p>Dd, say that with me, dd.  This sound is in dime, redo, smiled.</p>
<p>Tt, say that with me, tt.  This sound is in washed, untie, tip.</p>
<p>Vv.  This sound is in value, of, love.</p>
<p>Ff.  This sound is in staff, enough, phone.</p>
<p>Bb, bb.  This sound is in big, sob, abandon.</p>
<p>Pp, pp.  This sound is in pan, ship, reapply.</p>
<p>Gg, gg.  This sound is gap, exhibit, fog.</p>
<p>Kk, kk.  This sound is in choir, quiet, back.</p>
<p>Th, th.  This sound is in thanks, filthy, with.</p>
<p>Th, th.  This sound is in bother, this, bathe. Ss, ss.</p>
<p>This sound is in ice, some, ax.</p>
<p>Zz, zz.  This sound is in lazy, flowers, possess.</p>
<p>Sh, sh.  This sound is in polish, ocean, issue.</p>
<p>Zh, zh.  This sound is in beige, vision, azure.</p>
<p>Ch, ch.  This sound is in chase, march, chapter.</p>
<p>Jj, jj.  This sound is in joy, grudge, change.</p>
<p>Hh, hh.  This sound is in happy, rehash, hi.</p>
<p>Rr, rr.  This sound is in wrong, operate, ear.</p>
<p>Yy, yy.  This sound is in yummy, yes.  And it often occurs in the EW as in FEW diphthong in words like music.</p>
<p>Mm, mm.  This sound is in words like my, mumble, some.</p>
<p>Nn, nn.  This sound occurs in the words nine, no, undo.</p>
<p>Ng, ng.  This sound occurs in the words ring, thanks, anger.</p>
<p>Ll, ll.  This sound occurs in the words follow, lie, feel.</p>
<p>Ww, ww.  This sound occurs in the word quiet, will, one.</p>
<p>Great.  Familiarizing yourself with these symbols should make it easier to study pronunciation.  That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

And my answer is always, unfortunately, the sounds of American English do not correspond one-to-one with the letters of the alphabet. To know for sure how a word is pronounced, you need to either hear a native speaker say the word, or look up the word in a dictionary that has the International Phonetic Alphabet transcription.Let’s look at the letter Y. In the word ‘syringe’, it is the schwa, uh, uh, syringe. In the word ‘you’, it is the yy sound. You. In the word ‘my’, it is the ‘ai’ as in ‘buy’ diphthong. My. In the word busy, it is the EE vowel. Busy.</p>

I often get emails from people asking questions like, why is the CH in Chicago pronounced differently than the CH in choice. And my answer is always, unfortunately, the letters in English do not correspond one-on-one with the sounds of English. To know exactly how a word is pronounced, you have to look up the International Phonetic Alphabet transcription of the word. Today we’re going to look at the letter A and all the different sounds it can represent.In the word ‘exact’, it’s the AA sound, exact. In the word ‘father’, it’s the AH sound. Father.

<h2 id="Why-English-Pronunciation-is-so-Hard"><a href="#Why-English-Pronunciation-is-so-Hard" class="headerlink" title="Why English Pronunciation is so Hard"></a>Why English Pronunciation is so Hard</h2><p>Today we’re going to take a look at why studying English pronunciation can be so hard.</p>
<p>Let’s step through a series of words and see what happens to the sounds as we change some of the letters. Through. Step through. That’s a good place to start. Through, a preposition, a handy little word, begins with the unvoiced TH. Th, the R consonant, thr-, and the oo vowel. Through. Through. Now what would happen if we drop the R? Thoo, thoo, no, that’s not right. Through, drop the R, not thoo, but actually, though. So, the TH, th, th, is now voiced. And the vowel sound has changed to the OH diphthong. Though. Ok. What would happen if we add a T? Thowt. Thowt. No, that’s not right. That word is pronounced ‘thought’. Ok, so we’ve switched back to an unvoiced TH, now we have the AW vowel, and a final T. Thought. Thought. Ok.</p>
<p>So what would happen if we drop the TH and add a B? Thought becomes bought. And that IS how that word is pronounced. Excellent! Bought. Now what would happen if we drop the final T? Bought becomes bah. But it doesn’t, it’s not pronounced ‘bah’. It’s pronounced bough. Ok, so the AW vowel changes to the ‘ow’ diphthong. Bough, bough. Ok. What would happen now if we switched out the B for a C? Bough becomes cow. Yes! Cow is a word. But wait, that’s now how cow is spelled, this is how cow is spelled. So this, even though it was bough, isn’t cow, it’s cough. Cough. So we have the AW vowel, and somehow, an F consonant has crept in. Cough. Ok, cough. What would happen then if we drop the C, add an EN? Since it was cough, surely this must be enough. No, that’s not what it is. It’s enough. So the AW vowel changes to the UH vowel. But somehow that F sound stays in there. Enough, enough. And I think that’s about what I’ve had. I think I’ve had about enough of OUGH and its thousands of pronunciations. That’s it, I’m out.</p>
<h2 id="Letter-S-Pronounced-z"><a href="#Letter-S-Pronounced-z" class="headerlink" title="Letter S Pronounced [z]"></a>Letter S Pronounced [z]</h2><p>This video comes to you from Dillon, Colorado, where I’m spending Christmas with my family. I’m going to introduce you to my cousin and my cousin’s husband. Do you notice anything interesting about how those words are pronounced? If not, stay tuned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, I’m Rachel’s cousin Nikki.<br>I’m Rachel’s cousin’s husband, Steve.<br>Did you notice how they pronounced the words ‘cousin’ and ‘husband’? Listen again.<br>Hi, I’m Rachel’s cousin Nikki.<br>I’m Rachel’s cousin’s husband, Steve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you notice how they pronounced the S as a Z sound? This is actually quite common in American English. I’ve done a video on how to pronounce plural nouns. There are many cases there where the final S will be pronounced as a final Z. The same rules apply to third person verb conjugations. But in the words ‘cousin’ and ‘husband’, they’re not plural nouns, and they’re not third person verb conjugations. They’re simply words where the S is pronounced as a Z. Unfortunately, there are no rules to tell you why the S is pronounced as a Z. But there are a whole slew of words where this is the case, and they just have to be memorized.</p>
<p>Two days ago, my cousin’s husband Steve took me snowboarding. Unfortunately, because I’m not very good at it, I fell many times. And I’ve ended up with a huge bruise on my knee. Both knees, actually. Did you notice? Because, with a Z. But also, did you notice, bruise. Spelled with an S, pronounced with a Z.</p>
<p>>&gt; Don’t believe her, she did an excellent job. Do believe her about the bruise, though.<br>>&gt; Yes, the bruise is, is not a lie.</p>
<p>Other words where the S is pronounced as a Z: is, his, use. Now, let’s stop for a minute and talk about use. In verb form, the S in ‘use’ is pronounced as a Z. But when it’s a noun, use, it’s pronounced as an S. So that’s one way you can differentiate between which form of the word is being used. This also applies to a few other words, for example, house. As a noun it is an S, and as a verb, house, it is a Z. Was, design, lose. These are just some of the many words where the S will be pronounced as a Z. Special thanks to my cousin and her husband for being in this video with me. That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

<p>A. A is simply the ‘ay’ as in ‘say’ diphthong [e]. A. So you can see the jaw goes from being more dropped, A, to closing more, A, as the tongue reaches up towards the roof of the mouth for the second part of the diphthong. A. The next letters all have the ‘ee’ as in ‘she’ vowel sound [i] where the corners of the mouth pull a little bit wide, ee, and the tongue raises very high, ee, in the front/mid part of the mouth. B. B had the B consonant sound where the lips start together, bb B. And opens into the ‘ee’ as in ‘she’ vowel sound. C. C begins with the S consonant sound, ss, and moves into the ‘ee’ as in ‘she’ sound. C. D. D begins with the D sound, dd, dd, the voiced consonant, and moves into the ‘ee’ as in ‘she’ vowel sound. D. E is simply the ‘ee’ as in ‘she’ vowel sound. E.</p>
<p>F. F begins with the ‘eh’ as in ‘bed’ vowel sound [e], which has quite a drop in the jaw, eh, eh, F. It then finishes with the F consonant sound where the bottom lip moves up and touches the top teeth, ff, and you release air through that. It is unvoiced. F. G. G again has the ‘ee’ as in ‘she’ vowel sound. It begins with the ‘jj’ as in ‘jar’ consonant sound. G. H. H begins with the ‘ay’ as in ‘say’ diphthong, just like the letter A, but it ends with the ch’ as in ‘char’ consonant sound. H. Ch, ch where you release just air though the mouth position. H. I. I is pronounced with the ‘ay’ as in ‘buy’ diphthong [a]. I. J. J begins with the ‘jj’ as in ‘jar’ consonant sound, jj, it then has the ‘ay’ as in ‘say’ diphthong. J, J. K begins with the kk K consonant sound and then has the ‘ay’ as in ‘say’ diphthong. K.</p>
<p>The next three consonants all start with the ‘eh’ as in ‘bed’ vowel sound. L, L begins with the eh sound and moves into the L sound, where the tip of the tongue, L, L, moves up to touch the roof of the mouth just behind the teeth. L. M. M begins with the eh sound and then finishes with the M consonant sound where the lips come together – M, mm, mm – while you make noise with the vocal cords. M. N. N begins with the eh sound and moves into the N consonant sound. N, nn, where the tongue raises to the roof of the mouth and the lips remain open. N, N. The letter O is simply pronounced with the ‘oh’ as in ‘no’ diphthong [o]. O, O.</p>
<p>P. P begins with the P consonant sound, pp, where the lips are together and you release air. It then goes into the ‘ee’ as in ‘she’ vowel sound. P. P. Q. Q begins with the unvoiced kk K consonant sound, and then has the ‘ew’ as in ‘few’ diphthong [ju]. Q. R. R begins with the ‘ah’ as in ‘father’ sound [a] and then moves immediately into the R consonant sound. R, R. S. S begins with the ‘eh’ as in ‘bed’ vowel sound. Eh, Eh, S S. It then moves into the S consonant sound. S. T. T begins with the unvoiced tt T consonant sound and then has the ‘ee’ as in ‘she’ vowel sound. T T.</p>
<p>U. The letter U is pronounced with the ‘ew’ as in ‘few’ diphthong. V. V begins with the voiced vv consonant sound where the bottom lip moves up to the top teeth. V, v, followed by the ‘ee’ as in ‘she’ vowel sound. V. W. W begins with the D consonant sound. dd. It then moves into the ‘uh’ as in ‘butter’ followed by the B consonant sound. Double. It then has the schwa and the dark L sound. Double, W. And the ‘ew’ as in ‘few’ diphthong. W. The accent is on the first syllable. W. X. X begins with the ‘eh’ vowel sound, it then has the K and the S consonant sounds together. Eh kk ss. X. Y. Y begins with the W consonant sound, where the lips are in a tight circle. It then opens into the ‘ay’ as in ‘buy’ diphthong. Y. Z. Z begins with the voiced consonant, zz, followed by the ‘ee’ as in ‘she’ vowel sound. Z.</p>
<p>And now, all of the letters of the alphabet. Listen and repeat. If you can record this, that would be helpful. You can then listen to it and compare your pronunciation with mine to see if there are any errors.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Pronounce-‘QU’"><a href="#How-to-Pronounce-‘QU’" class="headerlink" title="How to Pronounce ‘QU’"></a>How to Pronounce ‘QU’</h2><p>You may have noticed that there are different pronunciations for the letters QU. Most common is the kk [k] ww [w] sounds I put together as in ‘quick’ or ‘question’. However, there are three other sounds. For example, it can make the kk sound without the W sound: for example, the word antique. Antique ends with the kk sound. Other examples: liquor, critique, unique, mosquito, baroque. ‘The antique chest of drawers if from the Baroque period.’</p>
<p>There are certain cases where the letters QUE make the kei sound. That is, the kk consonant sound followed by the ‘ay’ as in ‘say’ diphthong [eɪ].Examples: applique and bouquet. ‘He bought me the most lovely bouquet of flowers.’ And finally, there is just one word that fits this case, as far as I can find, and that is the word bar-b-que. Here, the QUE is pronounced kjoo: that is the kk consonant sound with the ‘ew’ as in ‘few’ diphthong [ju]. ‘I love bar-b-que chicken and baked beans.’</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Pronounce-OUGH"><a href="#How-to-Pronounce-OUGH" class="headerlink" title="How to Pronounce OUGH"></a>How to Pronounce OUGH</h2><p>The letters ough, when together in a word , are quite an interesting case in American English. Sometimes they make a vowel sound, sometimes a diphthong sound, and sometimes a vowel and consonant sound.</p>
<p>\1. [oʊ] First, the ‘oh’ as in ‘no’ diphthong. For example, dough, thorough, although. I’m not going to go to the party, although my best friend is going to be there.</p>
<p>\2. [aʊ] The next case is the ‘ow’ as in ‘now’ diphthong. Samples of this case: bough, plough, drought. I we lost our crop to the drought last year.</p>
<p>\3. [u] Next: the ‘oo’ as in ‘boo’ vowel. Through, throughout. I check my email throughout the day.</p>
<p>\4. [ɔ] The ‘aw’ as in ‘law’ vowel sound. Thought, fought, bought. I bought it yesterday. Those are the four vowel or diphthong sounds. Now, there are three cases in which these four letters make a vowel sound plus a consonant sound.</p>
<p>\5. [αF] In the first case it makes an ‘ah’ as in ‘father’ and F sound. Cough, trough. I have a terrible cough and a headache.</p>
<p>\6. [ʌF] It can also make the ‘uh’ as in ‘butter’ with the F consonant sound: rough, enough. That is enough roughhousing!</p>
<p>\7. [əP] And finally a word that is an alternate spelling, and as far as I know, this is the only case for this pronunciation of OUGH, and that is the word hiccough. It is more commonly spelled H-I-C-C-U-P, but it can be spelled with an OUGH. And then it takes the schwa the the P sound. Hiccough, hiccough. I’ve had the hiccoughs for three hours.</p>
<p>So, to recap the 7 ways these 4 letters can be pronounced when together in a word are: oh, ow, oo, aw, ah-ff, uh-ff, uh-pp. Though, bough, through, thought, cough, enough, hiccough.</p>
<h2 id="The-Cat’s-Out-of-the-Bag"><a href="#The-Cat’s-Out-of-the-Bag" class="headerlink" title="The Cat’s Out of the Bag"></a>The Cat’s Out of the Bag</h2><p>Well, the cat’s out of the bag. Several of you have guessed my secret.</p>
<p>That cat’s out of the bag. What a great idiom. In this American English pronunciation video, we’ll go over how what it means, how to say it, and how to use it.</p>
<p>It would be hard to keep a cat in a bag wouldn’t it? I imagine it would struggle, it would move around a lot, and would want out.</p>
<p>>&gt; The cat’s out of the bag.</p>
<p>‘The cat’s out of the bag’ is an idiom in English that means a secret becomes known. For example:</p>
<p>>&gt; Hey, are you coming to Renee’s surprise party tonight?<br>>&gt; Yes, but it’s not a surprise anymore. The cat’s out of the bag, she overheard me talking about it.</p>
<p>Now, there’s something that I’ve been keeping from you, the Rachel’s English audience. It’s gotten harder and harder to keep you from knowing, and in my last video, quite a few of you noticed. The cat’s out of the bag. It’s not a secret anymore.</p>
<p>I’m pregnant. Over the course of our trip this summer, and this fall, I’ve been getting bigger and bigger. And now I’m about two months away from my due date. I’m due December 30, with a boy. This is my first baby. And my husband and I are really excited.</p>
<p>I’ve had a lot of fun over the past week reading your comments on Facebook and YouTube as some of you figured out that I’m pregnant. Thank you for your well-wishes.</p>
<p>So there it is, the cat’s out of the bag. Interestingly, I got a request this week to go over the phrase ‘out of’, so the timing is perfect for this idiom.</p>
<p>>&gt; The cat’s out of the bag.</p>
<p>The cat’s out of the bag. We have six words, and only two of them are stressed, which means you want the rest to be really short. Since all of these words go together to make one idea, they should all link together.</p>
<p>The first word is ‘the’. Voiced TH, schwa. Because this is a function word, it’s not very important. We don’t have to bring the tongue tip all the way through the teeth, th. You can instead press the tongue behind the teeth, the. It will squish through the teeth a little bit, the, the, but it doesn’t take as long as bringing the tongue tip all the way through the teeth, th, th, the. Th, th, the. The cat’s, the cat’s.</p>
<p>Here’s a stressed word. We’ve made it a contraction with ‘is’. ‘Cat is’ becomes ‘cat’s’. K sound, the AA vowel, aa. You might want to lift your top lip a little bit to get the right sound, aa. The tongue lifts high in the back and then comes down in the front. AA, ca-, ca-, cat’s. The TS cluster. Close the teeth and put the tongue to the roof of the mouth, cat-ts, stop the air, then release the air and the tongue tip down, keeping your teeth together for the S, ts, ts, ts. Cat’s. Cat’s. Do you hear how ‘cat’ is much stronger than ‘the’? The cat’s, the cat’s. That’s because ‘the’ is a function word. It’s less important. We don’t care about it as much. Cat’s is a content word. These are more important for the meaning, so they have clearer. That means we’ll make them longer. The cat’s, the cat’s.</p>
<p>Now we have three function words in a row. Out-of-the will be pronounced ‘outta the’. So the V in ‘of’ is dropped, and we want to link it to the word ‘out’. Outta, outta. What do you notice about the T? Outta. It’s a Flap T because it comes between two vowels. Just bounce the tongue once against the roof of the mouth, outta, don’t stop the air, outta, outta the. Outta the. Another ‘the’, pronounced just like the first ‘the’. You don’t need to bring the tongue tip all the way through the teeth.</p>
<p>Outta the. Practice that a couple times. Outta the, outta the, outta the. The cat’s, outta the. The cat’s out of the. The cat’s out of the.</p>
<p>And finally, one more stressed word, ‘bag’. Another word with the AA vowel. Drop your jaw and lift the top lip slightly, ba-, ba-. Back of the tongue is high, tongue tip is down. Bag. What do you notice about the pitch of this word? Bag. It goes down in pitch. Bag, bag. That’s what we want with a stressed syllable.</p>
<p>The cat’s out of the bag. [3x]</p>
<p>You can use this idiom in any setting, casual or business. We do use idioms in more formal speech and in work situations.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Pronounce-MAN-vs-MEN"><a href="#How-to-Pronounce-MAN-vs-MEN" class="headerlink" title="How to Pronounce MAN vs. MEN"></a>How to Pronounce MAN vs. MEN</h2><p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to go over the difference between the words ‘man’ and ‘men’.</p>
<p>These two words are similar, but not the same. Thanks to those out there in the Rachel’s English community who have suggested this comparison.</p>
<p>These words have a different vowel sound. ‘Man’ has the AA, and ‘men’ has the EH. But it’s actully not quite as simple as just comparing these vowel sounds. When the AA vowel is followed by a nasal consonant, like N, the sound changes a little bit. We’ll get to see that when we watch these words up close and in slow motion.</p>
<p>For ‘men’, the lips start closed and we engage the vocal cords for the M. Mmmm. Then we open into the EH vowel, me-. The jaw drops a good bit for this vowel. The tongue tip is forward and down, lightly touching the back of the bottom front teeth. The middle/front part of the tongue lifts towards the roof of the mouth, but it doesn’t get too close. Make the middle of the tongue wider as it lifts. Eh, men. Then the front of the tongue simply goes up to the roof of the mouth for the N, men. It stays wide and flat, the back is relaxed. Men, men.</p>
<p>‘Man’ starts the same way, with the lips closed, mm. Now we have the AA vowel, which changes into the UH vowel before we get to the N. So for the AA vowel, the jaw drops and the tongue tip stays forward, lightly touching the back of the bottom front teeth. The back part of the tongue stretches up, aa, maa-, maa-, maa-. Lift the top of the lip just a little bit. If we were making this a pure vowel, it would sound like this: AA, man. But that’s not how we say it. Even though that’s what it says in the dictionary, Americans relax it before making an N. So it sounds and looks like this: ma-uh-n. Did you see how every thing relaxed? My lips relaxed, and my tongue relaxed down, ma-uh-n. We do this with the AA vowel when it’s followed by N. Then, to make the N, the front part of the tongue simply goes up to the roof of the mouth, ma-uh-n. It stays wide and flat, the back is relaxed.</p>
<p>So the difference between these two words is: ‘men’ has a pure EH vowel. And ‘man’ has a modified AA vowel, where we start with the AA but relax into the UH sound.</p>
<p>Let’s compare these two words up close and in slow motion.</p>
<p>Here, the tongue position is almost the same. For the AA vowel, the back of the tongue is a little higher. Now we’re just going to play the EH vowel. Notice how the tongue flips up to the roof of the mouth for the N. Now we’ll play the ‘man’. See how the tongue relaxes down in the back before the N.</p>
<p>Now we’ll watch the two together. The word ‘man’ takes a little longer because the vowel changes.</p>
<p>Here, the tongue position is almost the same. For the AA vowel, the back of the tongue is a little higher. Now we’re just going to play the EH vowel. Notice how the tongue flips up to the roof of the mouth for the N. Now we’ll play the ‘man’. See how the tongue relaxes down in the back before the N.</p>
<p>Now from the front. Again, the tongue position looks almost the same here. But the tongue does look a little higher in the back for ‘aa’. Now watch how ‘man’ take a little longer as the tongue relaxes in the back.</p>
<p>Men. Man. [2x]</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Say-STAFF-vs-STUFF"><a href="#How-to-Say-STAFF-vs-STUFF" class="headerlink" title="How to Say STAFF vs. STUFF"></a>How to Say STAFF vs. STUFF</h2><p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to go over the difference between the words ‘staff’ and ‘stuff’. I have several videos comparing vowels, but in this video, we’re going to compare two different words. Thanks to the fan who suggested this topic. These two words, ‘staff’ and ‘stuff’, are a minimal pair. A minimal pair is a set of two words where only one sound is different.  ‘Staff’ has the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ vowel, and ‘stuff’ has the ‘uh’ as in ‘butter’ vowel.  For the ‘aa’ vowel, the jaw drops quite a bit, and the tongue raises in the back. That means you should be able to see a lot of tongue. Aa, aa. Also, the corners of the mouth may pull up and out a bit, exposing some of the top teeth, aa, aa. The ‘uh’ as in ‘butter’ vowel has relaxed lips and a relaxed tongue. It’s a stressed syllable in both ‘butter’ and ‘stuff’, so the jaw will drop a little, but the lips should be completely relaxed, stu-, stuff. And the tongue, too. Stuff.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look a these two words in slow motion.</p>
<p>Please put any questions and suggestions for videos in the comments.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s<br>English.</p>

<h2 id="EH-e-vs-AA-ae-Vowels"><a href="#EH-e-vs-AA-ae-Vowels" class="headerlink" title="EH [ɛ] vs. AA [æ] Vowels"></a>EH [ɛ] vs. AA [æ] Vowels</h2><p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to compare the vowels EH and AA. First, let’s start by comparing profile pictures of the two sounds.</p>
<p>Here you’ll see the EH as in BED vowel on the left, and the AA as in BAT vowel on the right.</p>
<p>For the AA vowel, you can see that it’s the back part of the tongue that raises up towards the roof of the mouth.</p>
<p>For the EH vowel, it’s the mid/front part of the tongue that is stretching up.</p>
<p>Also, for the AA, you can see that the jaw drops just a little bit more.</p>
<p>So, for the AA vowel, the tongue is raising here.</p>
<p>AA. And for the EH vowel, the tongue is raising more here. EH.</p>
<p>So, here for the AA and here for the EH.</p>
<p>AA, EH. When comparing the two sounds in isolation, you’ll also notice that the jaw does not drop as much for the EH sound, as the front part of the tongue is raising towards the roof of the mouth. AA, EH.</p>
<p>There’s a difference in the lip position as well.</p>
<p>For the AA vowel, you may find that you get a more accurate sound if you lift a little bit here with the top lip. AA, AA.</p>
<p>Whereas, for the EH sound, the lips remain very relaxed and neutral, EH, EH. Now we’ll see the two alternating up close. AA, EH, AA, EH.</p>
<p>To close, a few minimal pairs. Bat, bet.</p>
<p>Capped, kept. Jam, gem. Tack, tech. Rack, wreck.</p>
<p>I hope this video has made the difference between these two sounds a little more clear.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

AA vowel followed by nasal consonants"></a>Happy Easter! AA vowel followed by nasal consonants</h2><p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’ll </p>
<p>look at English in action and take a look at </p>
<p>the ‘aa’ vowel followed by nasal consonants.</p>
<p> >&gt; Hey Jovon, happy Easter.</p>
<p> >&gt; Oh, hey, happy Easter. </p>
<p>>&gt; Hi Ben.<br>>&gt; Hello Rachel.<br>>&gt; Happy Easter.</p>
<p>>&gt; Happy Easter.<br>>&gt; Ben brought a ham for us to eat. </p>
<p>>&gt; I brought a ham.<br>>&gt; Ben brings a ham every </p>
<p>year because he’s a dear. And I don’t mean \deer </p>
<p>the animal, I mean dear, D-E-A-R, a kind and </p>
<p>thoughtful person. ‘Dear’ and ‘deer’ are homophones.</p>
<p> >&gt; What is this, Ben?</p>
<p> >&gt; This is a ham. And it </p>
<p>is made with pineapple and brown sugar. </p>
<p>>&gt; Oh, delicious. Ham. This is a teachable moment. </p>
<p>>&gt; Here comes the ham. Now the word ham —</p>
<p>>&gt; (it’s really hot)<br>>&gt; — is an interesting word </p>
<p>because it’s the AA as in BAT vowel followed by </p>
<p>a nasal consonant, in this case, M. So even </p>
<p>though it’s written in IPA just with the H </p>
<p>consonant, AA vowel, and M consonant, it’s </p>
<p>not actually pronounced that way. That </p>
<p>. But we say, </p>
<p>ha-uh-m. And there’s that UH sound that’s </p>
<p>not accounted for in IPA: aa-uh, aa-uh. </p>
<p>Ham. So, if you add this UH sound to your </p>
<p>AA vowel, you’ll sound much more American. </p>
<p>Other examples, camera. AA-UH-M. Cam-, </p>
<p>Camera. This is also true if the sound </p>
<p>after the AA is the N sound. For example, </p>
<p>‘ant’. AA-UHnt. Ant. Now, one last thing. </p>
<p>If the AA vowel is followed by the NG consonant, </p>
<p>then it changes also, but, in a different way. </p>
<p>In that case it becomes a sound more like the</p>
<p>‘ay’ diphthong, ay. For example, in the word</p>
<p>‘thanks’: thanks. Or, bank, bank. So</p>
<p>pronounce your AA vowel this way when </p>
<p>it’s followed by N, M, or NG.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Michelle, what are you working on here?<br>I’m making Eggs Benedict.<br>Ooo.<br>So I’m poaching eggs —<br>Uh-huh.<br>And then making them with salmon and spinach.<br>Oh, that looks delicious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>>&gt; Jovon’s always taking pictures. It’s a good thing I’m used to the camera, right? So this is what I made for our meal. Some green—it probably doesn’t look as good under plastic, eh? Some asparagus. I roasted it yesterday, gonna serve it chilled with a dijon vinaigrette. Yum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What did you make, Kate?<br>I made Easter egg chocolate / peanut butter candy.<br>Oo, that looks good. Now these are special, right?<br> They’re special: they’re vegan.<br>They’re vegan.<br>No dairy.<br>Wow. Let me zoom up on that. Jovon’s been trying to sneak one of those ever since you made them yesterday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>>&gt; I found the little ladle. That’s a hard little phrase. Say that five times quickly! Little ladle [x5].</p>
<p>>&gt; Ben, this ham is delicious.<br>>&gt; Thanks.<br>>&gt; You guys are so clear, such good actors for my Rachel’s English audience. Totally natural.</p>
<p>>&gt; They’re hamming it up.<br>>&gt; They are hamming it up. Thank you, Matthew, for brining up another use of the word ‘ham’.</p>
<p>Matthew cleverly pointed out a second definition for the word ‘ham’. An actor or performer who overacts. As a verb: to act with exaggerated expression of emotion, to overact. So the idiom, to ham it up, simply means, to overact. Example sentence: He really hammed it up for the camera.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happy Easter, guys.<br>Happy Easter, Rachel.<br>Hope you’re learning lots of fun vocabulary.<br>They are.<br>We learned all about the word ‘ham’.<br>Ham.<br>Oo, ham.<br>That’s a good one.<br>It is a good one and —<br>It’s a nasal one.<br>— it’s sort of an odd word because it’s got this AA-UH sound.<br>haa, haaa. Like that.<br>Yeah. If you had to explain how you pronounce ‘ham’, what would you say?<br>Um, haa, aa.<br>There’s an H in there.<br>Yes?<br>There’s an A, with an aa, kind of an aa?<br>Very nasal aa sound.<br>M, and then an M, mm, mm.<br>So if you had to say it in slow motion, say it in slow motion.<br>Haaauhm.<br>There you go! I heard that good UH sound. HaQuyen?<br>Ham.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s watch this in slow motion. As you know, AA followed by M has an ‘uh’ sound. AA-uh, AA-uh. You can see HaQuyen’s tongue pull back to make that UH sound before her lips close for the M.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ham.<br>Yeah, nice<br>Got that in the profile.<br>Yep, she gave the profile so we can see the movement of the tongue and everything. Thanks guys!<br>You’re welcome Rachel.</p>
<p>You’re most welcome.</p>

<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Pronounce-the-Letter-A-1"><a href="#How-to-Pronounce-the-Letter-A-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Pronounce the Letter A"></a>How to Pronounce the Letter A</h2><p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to take a look at how the letter A is pronounced.This video highlights some of the work I’ve done on my Sound Chart on my website. I often get emails from people asking questions like, why is the CH in Chicago pronounced differently than the CH in choice. And my answer is always, unfortunately, the letters in English do not correspond one-on-one with the sounds of English. To know exactly how a word is pronounced, you have to look up the International Phonetic Alphabet transcription of the word. Today we’re going to look at the letter A and all the different sounds it can represent.In the word ‘exact’, it’s the AA sound, exact. In the word ‘father’, it’s the AH sound. Father. In the word ‘about’, it’s the schwa, the UH sound. About. In the word fall, it’s the AW sound. Fall. In the word ‘able’, it’s the AY diphthong. Able. In the word ‘share’, it’s the EH sound. Share. In the word ‘private’, it’s the IH vowel. Private.</p>
<p>So, when you see the letter A, you can’t necessarily make assumptions about how that letter is pronounced. It’s always best to look it up in a dictionary. Or, better yet, listen with your ears open as you hear native speakers. Make note of how they pronounce particular words.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

<p>To make the pure AA vowel, the jaw drops quite a bit, AA.</p>
<p>The tip of the tongue stays forward; it’s touching the back of the bottom front teeth, AA. The back part of the tongue stretches up.</p>
<p>The tongue is wide, AA. Because the tongue is high in the back and low in the front, you can see a lot of it. This is different from the ‘ah’ as in ‘father’ vowel, for example, where the tongue presses down in the back and you see more dark space in the mouth. AA, AH.</p>
<p>You can also see the corners of the mouth pull back and up a little bit. AA.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the pure AA vowel up close and in slow motion.</p>
<p>The tongue tip is down and the back of the tongue lifts. Here’s the word ‘sat’. The tongue position is easy to see because of the jaw drop needed for this vowel.</p>
<p>When AA is in a stressed syllable, the vowel will go up and come down in pitch, AA. Sat, AA. In an unstressed syllable, the vowel is flatter and lower in pitch, quieter, aa. This vowel is unstressed in the second syllable of ‘backtrack’. Let’s look up close and in slow motion.</p>
<p>In the first, stressed syllable, the jaw drops, and we see the corners of the lips pull back and up for the stressed AA. In the unstressed syllable, the jaw drops less. Let’s compare them.</p>
<p>On top is the stressed AA. You can see the jaw drops more. For the unstressed AA, the corners of the lips are a little more relaxed than in the stressed version, where they pull slightly back and up.</p>
<p>Generally, the unstressed version of a vowel or diphthong is more relaxed and doesn’t take the full mouth position, in this case, a little less jaw drop, and relaxed lips. This is because unstressed syllables are shorter, so we don’t take the time to make the full position.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this video, I said the AA vowel is not always a pure AA. This vowel changes when it’s followed by a nasal consonant. When it’s followed by the M or N sounds, the tongue relaxes in the back, making an UH sound after AA. AA-UH. It’s not a pure AA sound. Unfortunately, this change is not represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet. It’s still written with the same AA symbol. So, you just have to know when it’s followed by [m] or [n], it’s different.</p>
<p>We don’t say ‘man’, aa, ‘man’, with a pure AA. We say ‘man’, aa-uh, aa-uh, relaxing the tongue and corners of the lips before the consonant. You can think of this UH relaxation as the ‘uh’ as in ‘butter’ sound or schwa sound. Let’s look up close and in slow motion at the word ‘exam’.</p>
<p>First we see the familiar shape of the mouth, when the AA is in a stressed syllable. Watch how the relaxation that happens: the corners of the lips relax in. The tongue will relax down in the back. And the lips close for the M consonant.</p>
<p>This relaxation of the corner of the lips and back of the tongue happens when the AA vowel is followed by the N consonant as well. For example, the word ‘hand’. Haa-uhnd. Hand.</p>
<p>So, when you see this symbol followed by this symbol or this symbol, it’s no longer a pure AA. Think of relaxing out of the vowel, AA-UH.</p>
<p>If the next sound is the NG consonant, it’s a little different. Rather than ‘aa-uh’, the vowel changes into AY. It’s really like the AY as in SAY diphthong. First, the middle part of the tongue lifts towards the roof of the mouth, then the front part of the tongue. Let’s watch ‘gang’ up close and in slow motion.</p>
<p>The position for the first sound looks a lot like AA, but the part of the tongue lifting up is more forward. Gaaaang. Then the front part of the tongue arches up towards the roof of the mouth, while the tongue tip remains down.</p>
<p>When you see this symbol followed by this symbol, it’s no longer a pure AA. It’s more like AY. Gang. Thanks.</p>
<p>Pure stressed AA: Sat, aa<br>Pure unstressed AA: backtrack, aa<br>AA, aa, AA, aa.</p>
<p>AA vowel modified by M: exam, aa-uh<br>AA vowel modified by N: man, aa-uh<br>AA vowel modified by NG: gang, ay</p>
<p>Example words. Repeat with me:<br>Chapter, can, act, last, bank, bypass.</p>
<p>I hope this video helps you understand this sound. That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

You will hear one word spoken out of a word pair. And you need to decide if you are or are not hearing the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ sound. In the first set, the aa sound will be contrasted with the ‘eh’ as in ‘bed’ sound [ε].You’ll hear each word twice; guess what you are hearing: bat, bed, ban, man, head, sand, gas, pen, said.</p>
<p>The next set of word pairs have the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ and the ‘ah’ as in ‘father’ vowel sounds [α]: pond, hat, banned, rock, gnat, pat, cop.</p>

If you have not already watched the video on how to make that sound, you should watch that first. You will hear a word with the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ vowel sound and then be given time to repeat that word while looking at a picture for the correct mouth position for the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ sound. I encourage you to do this with a mirror so that you can watch your own mouth and make sure that you are taking the correct mouth position.</p>

I’m a little confused about the ‘bat’ sound when it precedes the consonants nn, ng, and mm – that is the N, NG, and M consonant sounds – because in dictionaries they are all written with the bat vowel sound.</p>
<p>But I actually find them to be more like something else. I’d really like to get this straight, thank you very much</p>
<p>This is an excellent point. I had been thinking of doing a blog entry on this myself and had not really jelled the idea and so thank you so much for this email. This is exactly right, that when the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ [æ] vowel sound is followed by an N [n], M [m], or NG [ŋ] consonant sound within the same syllable, the ‘aa’ vowel sound is really not a pure ‘aa’ vowel sound, even though it is written that way in IPA. This case is similar to the dark L sound, which I did a blog on and have since referenced many times. And the dark L sound is written in IPA simply as an L, but when it is at the end of a word or syllable, it is always preceded by a vowel-like sound no matter what else comes before it. Now, this is slightly different in that the case is only with the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ vowel followed by one of these three consonant sounds.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and break down an example. The word pan: it is written with the pp consonant sound, the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ vowel sound, and the nn consonant sound in IPA. Pp-aa-nn. Now, watch my mouth as I say the word: pan. The mouth does not open as much as it does on the pure ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ vowel sound. Pp-aa-nn, pan. So what is the vowel sound, if not a pure ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’? Pan. Paa-aa-aa – the first thing you can see is that the corners of the lips, though they do come up a little bit, it’s not as drastic a pull as it is in the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ sound. Pan, pan. It’s much more subtle. The tongue however, stays in the same position. Pan. So the tongue is the same as the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’. The other major difference is that the jaw doesn’t drop quite as much as it does on the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ sound. Pan, pan.</p>
<p>Here we see the two side-by-side. On the left is the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ purevowel sound being spoken on its own. On the right is the word pan being spoken. So you can see again that the corners of the mouth do not come back and up as much in the word pan as they do in the pure vowel sound,and the jaw does not drop quite as much. However, as you can see, the tongue position is the same. The other thing to note is that it is not a single sound, it is more of a diphthong sound – pan – of this modified aa going into a schwa before the N sound. Paa-uh-nn, paauhn, pan. A few other wordsthat have this ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ followed by the nn consonant sound: animal, tan, and, pan.</p>
<p>This modified aa vowel is the same when it is followed by the M consonant sound within the same syllable. For example, the word Pam. This is the same sound as in case 1 when the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ was followed by an N. It is this modified ‘aa’ sound followed by a schwa. Pam. Other example words: dam, am, ambiguous.</p>
<p>The third case: when it is followed by an NG ng sound. Now in IPA, when these are in the same syllable, again, the ‘aa’ vowel sound is writtenfollowed directly by the ng consonant sound. It is not, however, a pure aa sound. In this case, however, the sound is not the same as it is in the previous two cases where it was the modified aa followed by a schwa. In this case, when it is followed by the NG sound, it is actually like the ‘ay’ as in ‘say’ diphthong. Let’s take, for example, the word ‘anger’ and the word ‘danger’. An-anger, dan-anger. To me, the sounds like the exact same vowel sound preceding the ng, NG consonant sound. Anger, danger, ang, ang. Now, in IPA, the word anger is written with the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ sound, followed by the ‘ng’ sound. In IPA the word danger is written with the ‘ay’ as in ‘say’ diphthong. And as I’ve just said, to me, to my ear, these sounds are exactly the same. Anger. So, when the ‘aa’ sound is written in IPA, followed by the NG sound, as in anger, it is really pronounced much more as the ‘ay’ as in ‘say’ diphthong. A few more examples: hang, bang, language, fang.</p>
<p>So, the IPA is not a perfect tool. It doesn’t capture every sound within a language perfectly. And that is understandable, as language is such a complex thing. So the lesson here is when you read a word written in IPA with the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ sound, followed in the same syllable by an M or an Nconsonant sound, it is actually pronounced as a modified aa sound going into a schwa making a diphthong-like sound. And that modified aa is one in which the jaw does not drop quite as much and the corners of the mouth do not come back and up quite as much. When you see the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ sound followed by the ng NG consonant sound, within the same syllable, it is pronounced as the ‘ay’ as in ‘say’ diphthong.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Pronounce-AA-ae-–-Lesson-Excerpt"><a href="#How-to-Pronounce-AA-ae-–-Lesson-Excerpt" class="headerlink" title="How to Pronounce AA [æ] – Lesson Excerpt"></a>How to Pronounce AA [æ] – Lesson Excerpt</h2><p>This video contains excerpts from a pronunciation lesson I had with my friend from Turkey In this particular video, we are working on the sound ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’. When he was first learning this sound, aa it felt very awkward and overdone for him to drop his jaw so much. He was much more comfortable keeping it about here much more neutral. Aa. But this sound has a really large opening here in the jaw After he got more comfortable opening his mouthhe was also spreading his mouth, aa, aa and making it this big wide rectangle which is also not correct. It is not so much stretched this way as dropped here with the tongue going up and then down Aa, aa.</p>
<p>In this section, we are talking of the pronunciation of the word ‘capped’. Capped: in this context meaning the apex of something. For example, ‘I capped my career with a concert in Carnegie Hall. ‘ Capped. When he was not dropping his jaw, aa ‘ and was keeping it capped, capped, it sounded like ‘kept’, ‘which is past tense ‘keep’, as in, ‘I kept my cell phone in my purse’ ‘Capped, kept. Aa, aa, capped, kept.</p>
<p>Capped the life of … Aa … capped. Yep, it’s aa…do you see? my jaw dropps and my tongue– aa. Aa, yeah, aa. Capped, capped. So, your mouth needs to open more: ca. Really? yeah. But when you open it I want you to say aa. Aa. That was better, do it again. Aa. That was good. Now that feels kind of stupid right? But that’s the sound in English. Capped, capped, capped. Aa, aa, aa. Ok. capped. Capped. That was good.</p>
<p>Here we are talking about the word ‘elaborate’, aa. Elaborate — elaa. Elaborate. Aa. Elaborate. Yeah, do just ‘aa’. Aa. That is very good. Aa, aa.And I can tell that your tongue is doing it right. I learned. Good! You learned it.</p>
<p>I Here when he first says the word ‘spectacular’, watch how little movement there is in the mouth. It is very much like this. And on the second one, see how much he drops his jaw. And that is correct. …if not spectacular– spec-tAAc-ular. Spectacular.</p>

<h2 id="Explore-Maine"><a href="#Explore-Maine" class="headerlink" title="Explore Maine!"></a>Explore Maine!</h2><p>In this American English pronunciation video, you’re going to learn a little bit about one of America’s 50 States.  Can you guess which state this is?  A rocky coast, and very cold Atlantic water!  Also, beautiful pines.</p>
<p>This is Maine.  Maine is at the very top of the east coast of the United States.  Its pronunciation is quite straight forward.  The M consonant, the AY as in SAY diphthong, do drop your jaw for the first sound of that diphthong … and a final N, Maine.  Some of my students who are Spanish, Portuguese, and Mandarin speakers, among others, have difficulty with an ending N.  The tongue should be relaxed and flat, very forward, with the tip lifted so the the front part is at the roof of the mouth.  Maine, Maine.</p>
<p>I spent six days this summer at Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, just off the coast.  While camping in Acadia, we enjoyed exploring the coast and some beautiful hikes.</p>
<p>>&gt; So foggy!<br>>&gt; Looks like someone left their lobster cage.  Makes me want to have lobster for dinner.</p>
<p>Did you notice?  Both ‘lobster’ and ‘foggy’ are spelled with the letter O, and they’re making the AH as in FATHER sound. Look at how much my jaw drops for those sounds.  Foggy, lobster.</p>
<p>Another word with the O that has the AH as in FATHER vowel, rock.  And, dog.</p>
<p>>&gt; That was not planned.  I don’t even know whose dog that is.</p>
<p>Another word where the letter O spells the AH as in FATHER vowel is ‘moss’.  And I’m noticing, moss is all over the place here on the coast of Maine, I guess because it’s so damp.  But this is an example of moss.</p>
<p>I’m spending most of my time here on the coast of Maine.  The capital of Maine is Augusta, and that’s inland.  Let’s take a second to look at the word ‘inland’.  It looks like it should be in-land.  But actually, there’s a schwa in that second syllable.  It’s unstressed, and in this particular case, we do reduce the vowel.  Inland, inland.  This is just like island, island, where again, we have a schwa in that second, unstressed syllable.  Also notice, the S is silent in that word.  Island, inland.   Now, let’s take a look at the pronunciation of ‘Augusta’.</p>
<p>Augusta.  This is a three-syllable word with stress on the middle syllable.  da-DA-da.  The first syllable, unstressed, can be either the AW as in LAW vowel, or the schwa.  The second, stressed syllable, begins with the G consonant, has the UH as in BUTTER vowel, Augu-, and the ST consonant cluster followed by the schwa, -sta, -sta.  Augusta, Augusta.</p>
<p>You can’t come to Maine without trying its seafood, like this New England Clam Chowder.</p>
<p>>&gt; Very good.</p>
<p>Or this lobster roll, where lobster meat is mixed in with other ingredients to make a salad and served on a roll.  Maine is also known for its blueberries, so don’t miss blueberry pie if you visit.</p>
<p>I loved Maine and its slippery coast.  Have you ever been to Maine?  If so, tell me about it in the comments section, or better yet, practice speaking and record a video, and upload it as a video response to this video on YouTube.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

<p>Today I spent some time at the farmer’s market where I did things like buy these beautiful flowers. The words ‘farmer’ and ‘market’ both have the ‘ah’ as in ‘father’ vowel followed by the R consonant. I’ve noticed that this combination can be problematic for my students. It’s important to remember to make a good ‘ah’ vowel before moving into the R consonant. A lot of people want to rush this, and the two sounds end up getting combined to something like far-, far-, instead of fah-rr, fah-rr. So, it is true with this combination that your tongue will probably start moving back into the R as soon as you start the AH vowel. But it’s important to start the AH vowel with the tongue tip forward. Far, far. And make sure you have enough jaw drop to get the good AH vowel. When in doubt, always practice slowly. Ah-rr, farmer’s market. Farmer’s market.</p>
<p>The farmer’s market at Union Square has some interesting things, like hand-dyed yarn, seafood, beautiful flowers, and sometimes, if you’re lucky, free samples.</p>
<p>>&gt; Spicy.<br>>&gt; Is it?</p>
<p>Did you hear how the intonation went up at the end. Is it? This is true of questions that can be answered with yes or no. In general, other questions will go down in pitch at the end. For example, what does it taste like? Taste like? like? it? like? Listen again.</p>
<p>>&gt; Is it? [3x]<br>>&gt; Too spicy or just right?</p>
<p>Here the question will be answered with either ‘too spicy’ or ‘just right’. So, not a yes/no question. Therefore, the sentence goes down in pitch at the end. Just right. Right, right. Listen again.</p>
<p>>&gt; Too spicy, or just right [3x]<br>>&gt; Perfect.</p>
<p>There’s also a local vendor who brings lots of honey, and, with that, bees. After putting honey and bees on my finger, the beekeeper told me the only way to get them off is with a good shake.</p>
<p>The farmer’s market also has lots of great baked goods, like these cider donuts.</p>
<p>>&gt; Apple cider donuts.<br>>&gt; Oh, yum!</p>
<p>>&gt; Can I have some?<br>Can I have some? Again, a yes/no question, so the pitch went up at the end. Some? Some? Also, did you notice how I reduced the word ‘can’ to ‘kn’. We do this when it is a helping verb in a sentence. That is, not the main verb. Can I have some? Listen again.</p>
<p>>&gt; Can I have some? [3x]<br>>&gt; Yeah.<br>>&gt; Oh wow. It’s soft. That is good.</p>
<p>>&gt; Now hold up your apple.<br>>&gt; This is my honey crisp apple.</p>
<p>The word ‘apple’ is a great word to pick out and study for pronunciation, because many people have difficulty with the Dark L sound. It’s quite common to hear non-native speakers substitute the OH diphthong for the dark L. So we end up getting a sound like ‘app-oh’ instead of ‘apple’. App-oh, apple. So what’s the difference? When we substitute the OH diphthong, you can see that the lips will round. App-oh. This means that the sound is being formed here at the front of the mouth. But for the dark L, apple, ul, ul, the sound vibrates here in the back of the mouth, and even the throat. Ul, ul, oh, oh, ul, ul. So, how do you make the dark L? Ul, ul. To make this, the tongue shifts back a little bit in the back, so the tension is in the back of the mouth, back of the tongue. Ul, that’s what brings the vibration here. Ul, ul, apple, ul, ul, rather than app-oh, oh, oh. Apple, apple. There are lots of words that end with this dark L in an unstressed syllable, like ‘bottle’, ‘incredible’. So, it’s really worth getting the sound right. Ul, ul.</p>
<p>Grape. The ‘ay’ diphthong is another sound that my students sometimes have problems with. Ay, ay. We have to hear two distinctly different vowel sounds, so for the first sound, the jaw has to drop quite a bit, and that’s the part that my students generally miss. Ay, ay. For the second half of the diphthong, the tongue tip still stays down here, behind the bottom front teeth, but the front part of the tongue stretches up towards the roof of the mouth. That’s what brings the jaw up. Ay, ay, grape.</p>
<p>So, if you ever find yourself in the New York area, I do recommend hitting up the farmer’s market in Union Square.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Pronounce-AH-vs-UH"><a href="#How-to-Pronounce-AH-vs-UH" class="headerlink" title="How to Pronounce AH vs UH"></a>How to Pronounce AH vs UH</h2><p>In this American English pronunciation video we’re going to talk a little more about the vowels EE and IH.First, let’s take a look at some photos comparing the mouth positions.</p>
<p>Here we have the AH and UH vowels in profile. You can see for the AH vowel that the jaw might drop a little bit more. Also, the tongue position has a little bit of tension in it. That’s because the tongue is flattened a little bit. In the UH vowel, the tongue is completely relaxed. Now you’ll see the mouth from the front, alternating between the AH and the UH sounds. Watch the subtle change in jaw drop. And see if you can notice the subtle change in tongue position as well.</p>
<p>AH, UH [3x].</p>
<p>So, for the AH sound, the jaw will drop a little bit more, and the tongue will push down a little bit in the back. But these differences are subtle. The placement of the voice also comes into play. Check out the video I made introducing the concept of placement. For the AH vowel, AH, the sound is more here, AH. For the UH vowel, UH, it’s more here. The differences are subtle. It’s tough. Here are some minimal pairs.</p>
<p>Fond, fund. Shot, shut. Lock, luck. Robber, rubber. Stock, stuck. Cop, cup.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

<p>This vowel needs a lot of jaw drop. Ah.</p>
<p>The tongue tip lightly touches behind the bottom front teeth, and the back part of the tongue presses down a little bit.</p>
<p>Ah. The lips are neutral, very relaxed. Ah. Because the tongue presses down in the back, you can see further into the dark space in the mouth. Let’s see that by watching this vowel up close and in slow motion.</p>
<p>The lips are relaxed, and the tongue is lowered in the back. The inside of the mouth is dark.</p>
<p>The word ‘job’. The jaw drops, and the tongue presses down in the back.</p>
<p>Ah. When this vowel is in a stressed syllable, the voice will go up and come down in pitch, ah, job, ah. When it’s in an unstressed syllable, it won’t be as long, and it won’t have the up-down shape of the voice, ah, ah. For example, in the word ‘blockade’, ah, ah, blockade.</p>
<p>The mouth position looks the same: jaw drop, relaxed lips, and tongue pressed slightly down in the back. But because the pitch is flatter and the syllable is quicker, it sounds unstressed. Ah, ah.</p>
<p>Stressed AH: job, AH.<br>Unstressed ah: blockade, ah.<br>AH, ah. AH, ah.</p>
<p>Example words. Repeat with me:<br>Honest, occupation, hot, clock, October, soft.</p>
<p>I hope this video helps you understand this sound. That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
<h2 id="Vowel-Comparison-1"><a href="#Vowel-Comparison-1" class="headerlink" title="Vowel Comparison"></a>Vowel Comparison</h2><h2 id="How-to-Pronounce-QUARTER"><a href="#How-to-Pronounce-QUARTER" class="headerlink" title="How to Pronounce QUARTER"></a>How to Pronounce QUARTER</h2><p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to go over how to pronounce the word ‘quarter’.</p>
<p>I’ve gotten quite a few requests for this word.  Thanks to everyone who requested it.  It’s a useful word.  We use it with time: quarter till six.  We use it with money:  I still need one more quarter.  We use it to mean 1/4th in lots of situations:  He’s working quarter time, I’ll give you a quarter of the brownie.</p>
<p>This is a two-syllable word with stress on the first syllable.  This means the second syllable should be noticeably shorter.  DA-da, quarter, DA-da, quarter.</p>
<p>We begin with the KW consonant cluster.  Kw, kwwwwww, quarter, quarter.  But here’s a tip to make it simpler: a lot of Americans, myself included, won’t make the W sound. We’ll just make the K sound, and then go right into the vowel:  so it’s quar-, quar-, instead of quar-, quar-.  This is not what it says in a dictionary, but it’s what we do.  Listen to the examples again.</p>
<p>Quarter till six.</p>
<p>I still need one more quarter.</p>
<p>He’s working quarter time.</p>
<p>I’ll give you a quarter of the brownie.</p>
<p>So we have the K consonant, where the back of the tongue comes up and touches the soft palate, kk, kk, kk.  Qua-.  Then, if we’re skipping the W, we go right into the vowel.  If you want to make the w, round your lips more.  Qu. But here, I’ll focus on dropping it.  Quar-, quarter, qu-.  The vowel is the AW as in LAW vowel.  But it’s not a pure AW vowel, qua-, because it’s followed by the R sound.  When the AW vowel is followed by an R in the same syllable, it’s quite different.  Instead of AW, it’s aw, aw, aw.  What’s happening.  My lips are rounding a little bit more, qu-, and my tongue pulls back a little bit.  That brings the sound further back in my mouth.  Qua-, -ua-, instead of AW.  The reason is the R.  The tongue pulls back and up for the R, so it’s influencing this vowel.  Qua-, my tongue is lifting more and it’s a little further back than for a pure AW vowel.  Quar-, quar-.  Now we have the R sound.  The middle part of the tongue lifts up, and back a little bit, so the tongue touches the upper teeth in the middle of the mouth, about here, quar-, rr.  The front part is down so it’s not touching anything.  Keep this position in mind, because the schwa-R sound at the end is almost the same.</p>
<p>We have one sound in between, a Flap T.  This T is not a True T because it comes after an R, before a vowel.  To make the Flap T, the front part of the tongue, which isn’t touching anything for the R, bounces up to touch the roof of the mouth, quarter. It doesn’t stop the air.  Quarter, quarrrrrrrter.  So hold out the R:  nothing needs to change except for the bounce of the front part of the tongue, quarter.  Bring your tongue right back into position for the R to finish off the word, quarter.  Notice how my lips are flared for most of this word.  They do this for the R, quar-, quarter.  For the second R, they flare a little less because it’s in an unstressed syllable, so everything is less important, positions are more relaxed.  Quarter, quarter.<br>Let’s look at this word up close and in slow motion.</p>
<p>If there’s a word you’d like to learn how to pronounce, put it in the comments below.  And don’t forget to sign up for my mailing list.  If you like studying English, you’ll like it.  That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Pronounce-the-Letter-A-3"><a href="#How-to-Pronounce-the-Letter-A-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Pronounce the Letter A"></a>How to Pronounce the Letter A</h2><h2 id="English-How-to-Pronounce-AW-o-Vowel"><a href="#English-How-to-Pronounce-AW-o-Vowel" class="headerlink" title="English: How to Pronounce AW [ɔ] Vowel"></a>English: How to Pronounce AW [ɔ] Vowel</h2><p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to learn how to pronounce the AW as in LAW vowel.</p>
<p>This vowel sound, when pure, is quite similar to the AH as in FATHER vowel. In some areas of the United States, we don’t even make this sound. We always use the AH as in FATHER sound instead.</p>
<p>Also, when this vowel is followed by the R consonant, it changes. We’ll go over that.</p>
<p>First let’s study the mouth position.</p>
<p>To make this vowel, the jaw drops and the tongue shifts back. The tip of the tongue doesn’t touch anything. The lips flare a bit.</p>
<p>AW. One technique that might help you make this sound is to think of the cheeks coming in and shifting forward just a little bit, aw. This is a way to make it different from the AH as in FATHER vowel, where the lips and cheeks are totally relaxed. AW, AH.</p>
<p>Let’s watch up close and in slow motion.</p>
<p>The jaw drops, the lips flare out a little bit, and the tongue pulls back.</p>
<p>Let’s compare with the AH as in FATHER vowel, on top. In AH, the lips are relaxed. In AW, the lips flare. Also notice how the tongue pulls back in the AW vowel.</p>
<p>In a stressed syllable, this vowel has the up-down shape of stress. AW. AW. For example, in the word ‘saw’.</p>
<p>Jaw drops, lips flare, tongue shifts back.</p>
<p>In an unstressed syllable, the voice will be lower in pitch, quieter, and flatter. Unstressed syllables won’t be as long, aw, aw. AW, aw. The voice is unstressed in the word ‘on’, a function word, on. Function words are unstressed, aw, aw. Note, this word can also be pronounce with the AH as in FATHER vowel.</p>
<p>The vowel here is extremely quick since it’s in an unstressed syllable. The tongue tip isn’t quite forward. The tongue is in position just an instant before the tongue flips up to make the N.</p>
<p>Let’s compare the stressed AW in SAW, on top, with the unstressed AW in ‘on’, on the bottom. You can see the jaw drops less, the lips are more relaxed, and the tongue doesn’t shift back as much.</p>
<p>Unstressed syllables are shorter than stressed syllables, so often the unstressed version of a vowel or diphthong doesn’t take the full mouth position of the stressed version.</p>
<p>This vowel can be affected by following consonants. When the AW vowel is followed by the R consonant, the sound does change. The lips flare more, and the tongue pulls back more, and up a little bit. This is because we blend the position for the R with the position for the AW when the R follows the AW. Instead of AW, the sound is aw, core, aw, aw, AW.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another word. Sore, aw, aw, sore, aw, AW.</p>
<p>Let’s compare the pure AW with the AW followed by R, in the word ‘quarter’, on the bottom. You can see for the AW followed by R, the lips round more and the jaw drops less. Because of the lips, it’s hard to see the tongue, but it pulls back and up more than in a pure AW vowel, above.</p>
<p>Pure stressed AW: saw, AW<br>Pure unstressed AW: on, aw<br>AW, aw, AW, aw</p>
<p>AW modified by R: core, aw, aw.</p>
<p>Example words. Repeat with me.<br>Boss, long, runoff, lifelong, login, wrong, daughter.</p>
<p>I hope this video helps you understand this sound. That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Improve-American-English-Drop-the-Jaw"><a href="#How-to-Improve-American-English-Drop-the-Jaw" class="headerlink" title="How to Improve American English: Drop the Jaw"></a>How to Improve American English: Drop the Jaw</h2><p>This video is excerpts from a pronunciation lesson that I had with a friend from Turkey. In this particular video, I’ve chosen excerpts where we worked to break his habit of speaking with his jaw closed like this, which, as you can see, makes it difficult to understand. For whatever reason, many people, when they learn English, simply don’t open their mouth enough. This is especially problematic on vowels like ah as in father and eh as in bed where the jaw really needs to drop and the mouth needs to open. This is actually related to another blog I did in which I muted the sound and just spoke for a minute or so to draw attention and focus to the mouth so that people could observe just how much it really works in American English. So here are excerpts from that lesson.</p>
<p>Ceremony: I can see that your teeth are hardly leaving each other. C-eh. Eh, eh. Yeah, ce-re-mony. Good.</p>
<p>Across: Ok, uh – cross. Here’s what you’re doing: across. Cr-aw. How much space is between my teeth? Yeah, about like that. Across. That’s better, good.</p>
<p>Sound: The sound of a single… OK, sound. Sound. Yeah, perfect.</p>
<p>The cross: Cross. Cr-aw, cross. … cross marks…. One more time. The cross… Ok, your teeth are working, but they could come a little further apart. The cross… That’s better.</p>
<p>So the sounds we worked on there are the eh as in bed, the aw as in law, and the ow as in now. Ceremony. He wanted to say: ceremony. Eh, ceremony. Across. He wanted to say: across. Aw, across. Sound. He wanted to say: sound. Ow, sound.</p>
