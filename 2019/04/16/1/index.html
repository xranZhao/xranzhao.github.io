<p>They want to know how long it will take. That, of course, depends entirely upon the individual.</p>
<p>Really focused pronunciation practice can yield great results.</p>
<p>In this video, I’m gonna go over two different ways to study English to perfect your pronunciation.</p>
<p>All you need is the audio or video of a native speaker speaking.</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>First, we’re going to do a Ben Franklin exercise.</p>
<p>This is when you write down everything you can about what you hear: whether or not you hear words being linked, or if you hear something being reduced, for example.</p>
<p>Now, we’ll do this together to help you get an idea of how to listen to and analyze what you hear.</p>
<p>“ A lot of people ask me if it’s possible to sound like a native speaker– A lot of people ask me.”</p>
<p>So the first thing I notice is that this T is a flap T, it sounds like a D, “ a lot of, “ that’s because it’s coming between two vowel sounds.</p>
<p>I also notice that I hear these three words as one unit: “ a lot of, a lot of, “ with the stress happening on the middle word.</p>
<p>“ A lot of, a lot of people ask me–” I also notice that this word ends in a consonant, this word begins with a vowel, there’s no punctuation in-between, “ a lot of people ask, “ and I do hear that L as really linking to the beginning vowel sound: “ people ask.”</p>
<p>Another thing you’ll want to note as you listen is any sounds that you know are difficult for you.</p>
<p>For example, many of my students have problems integrating the AA sound into their speech.</p>
<p>They know how to do it, but they just don’t use it in speech.</p>
<p>So I would definitely, if was one of them, mark this AA vowel, so that I’ll be sure to note it, and then will hopefully begin to integrate AA into my speech when I see this word ‘ask. ‘ “ A lot of people ask me.”</p>
<p>Let’s keep going.</p>
<p>“ A lot of people ask me if it’s possible to sound like a native speaker– if it’s possible to sound, if it’s possible to sound–”</p>
<p>So, I notice the stress here: possible, first syllable is stressed, “ to sound, “ I notice that has stress too. “ –if it’s possible to sound–”</p>
<p>The word ‘to’ is definitely reduced to the schwa, so I may mark that so I don’t forget to reduce it. “ Possible to sound.”</p>
<p>“ If it’s, if it’s.” Here’s another case where one word ends in a consonant sound, the next word begins with a vowel sound, “ if it’s, if it’s, “ and I do definitely hear those connecting together. “ If it’s possible to sound.”</p>
<p>“ A lot of people ask me if it’s possible to sound like a native speaker– like a native speaker–”</p>
<p>I notice my voice goes up at the end here, “ speaker.” That’s because the sentence isn’t over, the next word is “ if.”</p>
<p>I also notice the stress is big, small, big, small, big, small. “ Like a native speaker.” DA da DA da DA da. “ Like a native speaker.”</p>
<p>Also, again here we have ending consonant sound/beginning vowel sound: like a, like a. I hear the K linking to the schwa. “ Like a. Like a native speaker.”</p>
<p>“ Native –” I hear this T as a D because again, it’s a T coming between two vowel sounds: will be a flap T, sounds like a D. “ Like a native speaker.”</p>
<p>In the entire sentence, I don’t hear any gaps or pauses between words.</p>
<p>So in some cases, there’s a very obvious link, like when one word ends with a consonant and the next word begins with a vowel.</p>
<p>But even when there’s not a very obvious linking sound, there’s never a gap between the words.</p>
<p>“ A lot of people ask me if it’s possible to sound like a native speaker–”</p>
<p>We’ve been working for several minutes, and here we are only half way through one sentence.</p>
<p>This is just an example of how you might take notes from the audio or video clip of your choice.</p>
<p>After you’ve listened several times and taken thorough notes, you then put the audio or video away and, from your notes, try to speak the way the native speaker was speaking.</p>
<p>If you can, record yourself, and then compare this to the native speaker.</p>
<p>This is how you can figure out where you still need to work.</p>
<p>And now we’ll do an imitation exercise.</p>
<p>In this video, you don’t look at the text. You’re not concerned with the actual words because you do already have ideas about how words should be pronounced.</p>
<p>So in this exercise you’re just listening.</p>
<p>And I loop things three times in an imitation exercise so that you begin to think about the pitch changes and the musicality of the speech, rather than the individual words themselves.</p>
<p>Repeat it back exactly as you hear it, even if you’re not sure of the individual words. It’s ok, that’s not what we’re going for in this particular exercise.</p>
<p>“ A lot of people ask me” [x3]</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>“ A lot of people ask me if it’s possible to sound like a native speaker” [x3]</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>“ if it’s possible to sound like a native speaker”</p>
<p>“ if you weren’t born in the US.” [x3]</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>Because of the internet, there really is an endless supply of audio and video where English is being spoken by native speakers.</p>
<p>I know looping something over and over, as in the imitation exercise, can be more of a hassle on your own.</p>
<p>That’s why, on my website, I do have both Ben Franklin and imitation exercises ready for you.</p>
<p>So I encourage you to take a look at these, or any other audio or video clip that interests you, and turn it into a pronunciation exercise: study it this way.</p>
<p>It will really take you far in your practice.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

This is my favorite breakfast. But sometimes, I do have eggs."></a>This morning for breakfast, I had Barbara’s Shredded Oats with milk. This is my favorite breakfast. But sometimes, I do have eggs.</h3><p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to study American English by looking at a short text. Topic: what I ate for breakfast.</p>
<p>I call this a Ben Franklin exercise.</p>
<p>This is when you take very good notes, very detailed notes, on what you’re hearing. And then go back and try to record yourself based on what you’ve written down, the notes.</p>
<p>Did you write down a flap T, or the way two words link together?</p>
<p>After you’ve recorded yourself, compare it to the original. Did you do everything that you wanted to do?</p>
<p>In this video, we’re going to take notes together.</p>
<p>This morning for breakfast, I had Barbara’s Shredded Oats with milk. This is my favorite breakfast. But sometimes, I do have eggs.</p>
<p>So let’s take a look at what’s happening here.</p>
<p>“ This morning for breakfast.” One of the first things I notice is how much this S and M were connected.</p>
<p>“ This morning, this morning.” It’s almost like the S went on the next word: “ smorning, smorning. This morning. This morning for breakfast.”</p>
<p>Did you notice how I pronounced the word “ for” ?</p>
<p>That was reduced to “ fer” , “ fer” , “ fer” . Very quick, with the schwa/R sound. “ For, for, for breakfast.”</p>
<p>“ This morning for breakfast.” Also I notice the rhythm here. “ Morn-“ and “ break-“ are the two stressed syllables.</p>
<p>“ This morning for breakfast.” They have that swooping up and then down shape of the voice that makes up a stressed syllable.</p>
<p>Let’s listen in slow motion.</p>
<p>“ This morning for breakfast.” [x2]</p>
<p>“ This morning for breakfast, I had Barbara’s Shredded Oats with milk.”</p>
<p>What do you hear as being the stressed syllables? I hear “ Barbara’s” , “ Shredded” , and “ milk” .</p>
<p>What else do you notice?</p>
<p>“ I had Barbara’s Shredded Oats with milk.” I notice that “ Barbara’s” is only two syllables, even though it looks like it might be three. We sort of leave this middle sound out here.</p>
<p>“ Barb-ra’s, -ra’s.” Also note this apostrophe S is the Z sound. That’s because the sound before is voiced, so the apostrophe S is also voiced. “ Zzz, zz, -ra’s, -ra’s. Barbara’s.”</p>
<p>I also notice that the ED ending here is pronounced as the IH as in ‘sit’ vowel, D sound.</p>
<p>That’s because the sound before was a D. ED endings are among the few cases in American English that follow regular rules.</p>
<p>“ I had Barbara’s Shredded Oats with milk.”</p>
<p>I notice that the word ‘with’ is not reduced, but it’s very flat in pitch because it is unstressed. “ With, with, with.” It’s also quite fast. “ With milk, with, with, with, with milk.”</p>
<p>“ I had Barbara’s Shredded Oats with milk.”</p>
<p>Let’s listen in slow motion.</p>
<p>“ I had Barbara’s Shredded Oats with milk.” [x2]</p>
<p>“ I had Barbara’s Shredded Oats with milk. This is my favorite breakfast.” What was stressed in that sentence? I heard “ fav-“ and “ break-“ .</p>
<p>Also, these three words, “ this is my” , those were incredibly fast. Listen again.</p>
<p>“ This is my favorite breakfast.”</p>
<p>So this string of three unstressed words, “ this is my” [x4]: very fast, and very connected.</p>
<p>I also notice that the word “ favorite” was only pronounced with two syllables, as if this letter was dropped. “ Fav-rit, favorite, favorite.”</p>
<p>“ This is my favorite breakfast.”</p>
<p>I’m also noticing this T pronunciation. The final T in “ favorite” was pronounced as a stop.</p>
<p>“ Favorite, favorite, favorite breakfast.” So, there was no release, tt, of the T sound. “ Favorite breakfast.”</p>
<p>Let’s listen in slow motion.</p>
<p>“ This is my favorite breakfast.” [x2]</p>
<p>“ This is my favorite breakfast. But sometimes, I do have eggs.”</p>
<p>Did you notice the lift here, where the comma is?</p>
<p>“ But sometimes, I do have eggs.” There was just a little pause there for the punctuation.</p>
<p>I also noticed how I stressed the word “ do” .</p>
<p>“ I do, I do have eggs.”</p>
<p>“ But sometimes, I do have eggs.”</p>
<p>The word “ eggs” , even though it’s a content word, a noun, which is usually stressed, doesn’t have that much stress, I notice, because it’s at the end of a sentence. “ I do have eggs.”</p>
<p>“ Eggs, eggs, “ with just a little curve up, and then down in the voice. “ I do have eggs.”</p>
<p>Also, the plural ending here, S, is pronounced as a Z. That’s because the sound before, the G sound, is a voiced consonant. “ Eggs, eggs.”</p>
<p>Let’s listen in slow motion.</p>
<p>“ But sometimes, I do have eggs.” [x2]</p>
<p>“ But sometimes, I do have eggs.”</p>
<p>So, just three little sentences. But we really were able to study a lot about American English pronunciation.</p>
<p>Let’s listen once in slow motion.</p>
<p>This morning for breakfast, I had Barbara’s Shredded Oats with milk. This is my favorite breakfast. But sometimes, I do have eggs.</p>
<p>I hope this has given you some ideas on how to take notes and study the speech of native speakers.</p>
<p>Do this on your own. Take video and audio clips that interest you, or that have topics that are important to your field of work.</p>
<p>After you take good notes, record the text yourself, and compare to the original recording. What do you still need to work on, or what did you do well?</p>
<p>This is a great way to improve your pronunciation.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

Sometimes I’ll ride along the Hudson River or in Central Park, and sometimes I’ll go visit friends in Brooklyn.</h3><p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to study American English by looking at a short text. Topic: free time.</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>I call this a Ben Franklin exercise.</p>
<p>This is when you take very good notes, very detailed notes, on what you’re hearing. And then go back and try to record yourself based on what you’ve written down, the notes.</p>
<p>Did you write down a Flap T, or the way two words link together?</p>
<p>After you’ve recorded yourself, compare it to the original. Did you do everything that you wanted to do?</p>
<p>In this video, we’re going to take notes together.</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>One of my favorite things to do with a free day is to ride my bike. Sometimes I’ll ride along the Hudson River or in Central Park, and sometimes I’ll go visit friends in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>“ One of my favorite things to do.”</p>
<p>“ One of my favorite.” I definitely hear “ one” and “ fav-“ as being stressed.</p>
<p>“ Of my” is very quick, very different than “ one” and “ fav” . “ Of my, of my, of my, of my, of my.” So I’m using the schwa here, and I am giving the V sound: “ of my, of my, of my, of my, of my” , but it’s very flat and quick.</p>
<p>“ One of my favorite.” [x3]</p>
<p>I notice that I’m dropping the middle, unstressed syllable in “ favorite” . So it’s not “ FA-vo-rit” , but simply, “ FA-vrit. Favorite. Favorite things.”</p>
<p>And I notice that I am making that a Stop T, I’m not releasing it. I’m going straight into the TH. “ One of my favorite things.”</p>
<p>“ One of my favorite things to do with a free day.” [x3]</p>
<p>“ One of my favorite things to do with a free day.” So I notice both the words “ free” and “ day” have a lot more length than the others.</p>
<p>“ Things” is a content word, it is a noun, but it’s more generic than “ free” and “ day” , I think that’s why I didn’t give it as much time. “ One of my favorite things to do with a free day.”</p>
<p>“ One of my favorite things to do with a free day.” [x3]</p>
<p>I notice, with the word “ to” , I am reducing that to the schwa sound. It’s not “ to do” , it’s “ t’do, ttt, t’do” .</p>
<p>“ To do [x3] with a free day.”</p>
<p>Also the article “ a” , of course, is a schwa. Now I pronounced the ending TH unvoiced, “ with a, with a” .</p>
<p>Sometimes when people link the ending TH that is unvoiced into a voiced sound, like the vowel schwa, they will voice it and say “ with a, with a” . But I left that unvoiced: “ with a, with a, with a free day.”</p>
<p>“ With a free day.” [x3]</p>
<p>“ Is to ride my bike. Ride, bike.” Those were the two longest words in that sentence fragment.</p>
<p>“ Is to ride my bike.” I notice again, I reduced this to the schwa sound. It’s not “ to” , it’s “ to, to, is to, is to, is to, is to ride, is to ride, is to ride my bike” .</p>
<p>“ Is to ride my bike.” [x3]</p>
<p>“ Sometimes I’ll ride along Hudson River.”</p>
<p>What did you hear as the most stressed syllables there? I’m hearing “ some-, ride, Hud-, Riv-“ .</p>
<p>As you practice your own speech, listen to it and make sure that you can pick out stressed syllables in a sentence.</p>
<p>If you can’t, then they all sound too much the same. And we’re lacking good rhythmic contrast.</p>
<p>So, it’s always good to study other speech, and to note what do you hear as being the longest syllables.</p>
<p>Usually it will go along with adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs.</p>
<p>“ Sometimes I’ll ride along the Hudson River.” [x3]</p>
<p>What else do you notice?</p>
<p>I notice the ending S here is pronounced as a Z. “ Sometimes I’ll ride.”</p>
<p>Also, did you notice how I pronounced that contraction? I didn’t say “ I’ll, I’ll.” I said “ I’ll, I’ll.”</p>
<p>So it sounded a lot like this word. In fact, it sounded just like this word. “ I’ll, I’ll.”</p>
<p>I used the “ aw” as in “ law” vowel. “ Sometimes I’ll, sometimes I’ll ride.” So, I reduced the contraction, which is already a reduction of “ I will” , to “ I’ll, I’ll, I’ll. Sometimes I’ll ride.”</p>
<p>“ Sometimes I’ll ride [x3] along the Hudson River.”</p>
<p>“ The Hudson River.” The word “ the” pronounced with the schwa.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s pronounced with an EE vowel. That would be when the next word begins with a vowel or diphthong.</p>
<p>Here it begins with a consonant, the H sound, “ Hudson, Hudson” , so it was a schwa. “ The Hudson, the Hudson River.”</p>
<p>“ The Hudson River.” [x3]</p>
<p>Did you notice how the second and unstressed syllable of “ Hudson” was pronounced? It’s written with the letter O, but there’s the schwa vowel in there.</p>
<p>As an unstressed syllable, it’s very fast, “ -son, -son, -son” .</p>
<p>And when the schwa is followed by the N sound, you don’t need to worry about making a separate schwa sound. It gets absorbed by the N. “ -Son, -son, -son, -son, Hudson. The Hudson.”</p>
<p>“ The Hudson River [x3] or in Central Park.”</p>
<p>I notice I did not reduce the word “ or” , that can be reduced to “ er, er. Hudson River or Central Park.” But in this case I didn’t. I said “ or” .</p>
<p>Wait, I just realized I missed the word “ in” .</p>
<p>“ Or in Central Park, or in Central Park.” Do you hear how fast the word “ in” is?</p>
<p>“ Or in, or in, or in, or in Central Park. Central.” Stressed syllable of “ Central” is the first one. “ Cen-, Cen-.” The second syllable has the schwa: “ -tral, -tral, -tral.”</p>
<p>“ In Central.” [x3]</p>
<p>Did you notice? I’m making more of a CH sound here instead of a T sound for the T in “ Central” .</p>
<p>“ Cen-tral, -tral, -tral.” This can happen when the T is followed by an R.</p>
<p>“ In Central [x3] Park, and sometimes I’ll go visit friends in Brooklyn.”</p>
<p>“ And sometimes.” I definitely dropped the D in that word, “ and sometimes, and sometimes” , reducing the word “ and” .</p>
<p>“ And sometimes.” [x3]</p>
<p>Let’s talk about stress in that last part of the sentence.</p>
<p>“ And sometimes I’ll go visit friends in Brooklyn.”</p>
<p>What did you hear as being the most stressed syllables? “ Some-“ , sort of, but even stronger, “ vis-, friends, Brook-“ . Verb, noun, noun. The content words.</p>
<p>And did you notice the contraction “ I’ll” ? Again, pronounced with the “ aw” as in “ law” vowel, reduced to “ I’ll, I’ll, I’ll, I’ll” .</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>“ And sometimes I’ll [x3] go visit friends in Brooklyn.”</p>
<p>Also, all of these words, as always in a thought group, were very connected.</p>
<p>I had a Stop T here in “ visit” , so I didn’t bother to release it, which would have made a little gap in my line. “ Visit friends, visit friends.”</p>
<p>“ visit friends [x3] in Brooklyn.”</p>
<p>Also, the ending Z sound of “ friends” linked into the beginning vowel of the next word, “ friends in, friends in, friends in, friends in Brooklyn.”</p>
<p>“ visit friends in Brooklyn.” [x3]</p>
<p>One of my favorite things to do with a free day is to ride my bike. Sometimes I’ll ride along the Hudson River or in Central Park, and sometimes I’ll go visit friends in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>I hope this has given you some ideas on how to take notes and study the speech of native speakers.</p>
<p>Do this on your own. Take video and audio clips that interest you or that have topics that are important to your field of work.</p>
<p>After you take good notes, record the text yourself and compare to the original recording. What do you still need to work on, or what did you do well?</p>
<p>This is a great way to improve your pronunciation.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
<p>So this is what I like to do with a free day. What do you like to do with a free day?</p>
<p>Record yourself talking about it, and post it as a video response to this video on YouTube. I can’t wait to hear about it.</p>

In Brooklyn.”"></a>“ I run in Fort Greene Park. In Brooklyn.”</h3><p>In this American English pronunciation exercise, we’re going to study some conversation. Today it’s going to be a Ben Franklin exercise, where we analyze the speech together. Today’s topic: what did you do today?</p>
<p>. . . . . . Great. Let’s get started.</p>
<p>“ Tom, what did you do today? “ “ Tom, what did you do today? “ Lots of interesting things happening here.</p>
<p>I noticed first of all that I’ve dropped the T here: “ what did, what did, what did you do? “ I’m also noticing I’m getting more of a J sound here, j-ou, j-ou. Whuh-dih-jou, dih-jou.</p>
<p>So the D and the Y here are combining to make the J sound. So we have wuh-dih-jou. “ What did you.” [x3]</p>
<p>“ Tom, what did you do today? “ The other thing I notice is that the T here is really more of a flap sound, a D, “ do duh-, do duh-, do today” , this is most definitely a schwa, so we’re reducing this unstressed syllable to be the schwa. “ Today, today, do today, do today.” “ Tom, what did you do today? “</p>
<p>“ Tom, what did you do today? “ -“ Today? “ -“ Today.” “ Today I woke up. . .”</p>
<p>Now here we have “ today” three times. Always, the first syllable is reduced to the schwa sound, but I’m noticing that these T’s are all True T’s, and not Flap T’s. That’s because they are beginning sentences. So, we’re not going to reduce that to a Flap T.</p>
<p>In the case up here, “ do today” , it came, the T in “ today” , came in between a vowel, “ do” , the OO vowel, and the schwa sound. And that’s why we made this a flap sound. But here we’re beginning a sentence, so we’re going to go ahead and give it the True T sound–though we will most definitely reduce to the schwa. “ Today.”</p>
<p>“ Today? “ -“ Today.” [x3] -“ Tom, what did you do today? “ -“ Today? “ -“ Today.” -“ Today I woke up. . .” Everything was very connected there, and I know that when we have something ending in a vowel or diphthong sound, and the next word beginning in a vowel or diphthong sound, that we want that to really glide together, “ today I.” [x3]</p>
<p>And anytime we have a word that begins with a vowel, we want to say, hmm, does the word before end in a consonant sound? It does. It ends in the K consonant sound, “ woke up, woke up” .</p>
<p>So, to help us link, we can almost think of it as beginning the next word, “ wo-kup, woke up. Today I woke up.” “ Today? “ -“ Today.” -“ Today I woke up, and I went for a run.”</p>
<p>“ And I went for a run.” Tom dropped the D here, connected this word “ and” to “ I” , “ and I” . [x3] This was the schwa sound, so he’s reduced “ and” . “ And I, and I, and I went for a run.”</p>
<p>“ For a, for a.” Tom reduced the vowel in the word “ for” to the schwa. And we’ve connected these two function words together, “ for a, for a, for a” , this is also a schwa. “ For a, for a, for a run, for a run, and I went for a run.”</p>
<p>Can you pick out the two stressed words here? “ Went, run” . Those are the words that have the most shape in the voice. The most length: “ and I went for a run” . “ And I went for a run.” Again, he’s got the intonation going up here at the end, because, comma, he’s giving us a list here. And there’s more information about to come.</p>
<p>“ Today I woke up, and I went for a run.” [x3] “ And, um, then I just worked.”</p>
<p>“ And, um. . .” Now here, Tom did pronounce the D, he linked it to the next word, beginning with a vowel, which is just this thought-word that we say when we’re thinking, “ and um, and um.” Again, the intonation of the voice is going up at the end, “ and um” , signaling, comma, not a period, more information coming.</p>
<p>“ And, um, [x3] then I just worked.” “ Worked, worked, then I just worked.” Here, finally, we have the intonation of the voice going down at the end.</p>
<p>So we know, period, end of the sentence, end of the thought. “ Then I” : he connected this ending consonant to the beginning vowel, the diphthong “ ai” , I, to smooth that out. “ Then I, then I, then I just worked.”</p>
<p>Did you notice? Tom dropped the T here. We did not get “ just worked, just worked” . He didn’t release it. This happens often when we have a word that ends in a cluster with a T when the next word also begins with a consonant.</p>
<p>In these cases, often, the T will get dropped. “ I just worked.” [x3] Do you notice that the -ed ending is pronounced as a T sound. That’s because the sound before, the K, is unvoiced. So this ending will also be unvoiced. “ Worked, worked.”</p>
<p>“ . . . and I went for a run. And, um, then I just worked.” [x3] “ So, where do you run? “</p>
<p>“ So, where do you run? “ Now, this is a question, but did you notice the intonation went down at the end? “ Run, run.” That’s because it’s a question that cannot be answered with just “ yes” or “ no” .</p>
<p>Yes/no questions go up in pitch at the end. All other questions tend to go down in pitch at the end. “ Where do you run? “ Do you hear the stressed words in that question?</p>
<p>“ Where, run.” “ So, where do you run? “ Longer words, more up/down shape of the voice. “ Where, run.” “ So where do you run? “</p>
<p>“ So, where do you run? “ [x3] -“ I run in Fort Greene Park.” What do you hear as being the stressed syllables there?</p>
<p>“ I run in Fort Greene Park.” [x3] “ I run in Fort Greene Park.” I hear “ da-da-da-DAA-DAA-DAA” . Definitely I hear “ Fort” , “ Greene” , and “ Park” all being longer, all having that shape in the voice.</p>
<p>“ I run in Fort Greene Park.” Also, “ I” is a little bit more stressed than “ run in” . “ I, I, DA-da-da, DA-da-da, I run in, I run in, run in, run in.” So those two words are really linked together because we have and ending consonant and a beginning vowel.</p>
<p>“ Run in, run in, I run in, I run in Fort Greene Park.” “ I run in Fort Greene Park. [x3] In Brooklyn.”</p>
<p>“ In Brooklyn.” Brooklyn, a two syllable word. One of the syllables will be stressed. What do you hear as being stressed? “ Brooklyn, Brooklyn.” Definitely it’s that first syllable. “ Brook-, Brook-, Brooklyn, Brooklyn.”</p>
<p>“ In Brooklyn.” [x3] -“ So, what are you doing after this? “ “ So, what are you doing after this? “ How was I able to say so many words quickly, but still be clear?</p>
<p>First of all, I’m dramatically reducing the word “ are” to the schwa-R sound, “ er, er” . That means the T here is now coming between two vowel sounds, and I’m making that a flap T sound, which sounds like the D between vowels. “ What are.” [x3]</p>
<p>Also the word “ you” is unstressed, so it’s going to be in that same line, “ what are you” [x4], very fast, quite flat, lower in volume. “ What are you doing? “ Now here we have a stressed word, “ do-, doing. Doing, what are you doing? “</p>
<p>Do you hear how the syllable “ do” sticks out of that phrase more than anything else? “ What are you doing? “ [x2] “ After this.” Another stressed word here.</p>
<p>“ So, what are you doing after this? “ [x5] -“ After this, nothing.” Tom’s speaking a little bit more slowly than I am here. “ After this, nothing. “</p>
<p>We have two 2-syllable words here. Which syllable is stressed? Let’s take first the word “ after” . If you think you hear the first syllable as being stressed, you’re right.</p>
<p>“ Af-, after, -ter, -ter, -ter.” The second syllable: very low in pitch, flat, and quick. “ After.” What about the word “ nothing” ? Again, it’s the first syllable. ING endings, even though this isn’t an ING verb, will be unstressed. “ Nothing, no-, no-, nothing.”</p>
<p>“ After this, nothing.” [x3] -“ No plans.” -“ No plans.” Nothing reduces in this phrase. I’m really hearing this as two different stressed words. They’re both one syllable, “ no plans. No plans.”</p>
<p>“ No plans.” -“ No plans.” [x3] -“ Should we get dinner? “ -“ Yeah.” “ Should we get dinner? “ One of the things that I notice is that I’m dropping the D sound: “ should we, should we” .</p>
<p>“ Should we get.” [x3] That’s helping me say this less-important word even faster. “ Should we get dinner? “ “ Should we get dinner? “ [x3]</p>
<p>I notice that the T here is a Stop T, I don’t release it. It’s not “ get dinner” , it’s “ get, get, get, get dinner, get dinner. Should we get dinner? “ “ Should we get dinner? “ [x3]</p>
<p>Do you notice, in this question my voice does go up in pitch at the end. “ Dinner, dinner.” That’s because this is a yes/no question. Pitch goes up. “ Should we get dinner? Yeah.”</p>
<p>As you probably know, a more casual way to say “ yes” . “ Should we get dinner? Yeah.” “ Should we get dinner? “ -“ Yeah.”</p>
<p>Working this way with any video or audio clip can help improve your listening comprehension and your pronunciation. That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

But I do move around a lot. I’ve been in New York for about five years, and I’ve already moved four times.</h3><p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to study American English by looking at a short text. Topic: where I live. . . . . . .</p>
<p>I call this a Ben Franklin exercise. This is when you take very good notes, very detailed notes, on what you’re hearing. And then go back and try to record yourself based on what you’ve written down, the notes.</p>
<p>Did you write down a flap T, or the way two words link together? After you’ve recorded yourself, compare it to the original. Did you do everything that you wanted to do?</p>
<p>In this video, we’re going to take notes together. I live in New York City, in Manhattan, currently in midtown. But I do move around a lot. I’ve been in New York for about five years, and I’ve already moved four times.</p>
<p>One of the first things I notice is how my voice goes up at the end of the word “ city” , “ city, city” . That’s because of the comma here, and I’m not done, I’m going to keep going, I’m going to say more about that.</p>
<p>“ I live in New York City.” [x2] I also notice how connected that first line is. “ I live in New York City.” There are no breaks.</p>
<p>“ I live in New York City.” [x2] And I notice the ending consonant sound of “ live” links into the beginning of the next word, “ live in, v-in, v-in, v-in, live in.”</p>
<p>“ I live in New York City. [x3] In Manhattan.” “ In Manhattan.” Again, my voice went up at the end.</p>
<p>“ Manhattan.” Again, there’s a comma here, and I’m about to give more information about that. “ New York City, Manhattan” , more specifically “ midtown” . So, my voice is going up at the end of each of these little phrases to signal that there is more information yet to come about this.</p>
<p>“ In Manhattan.” [x2] I notice that the stressed syllable of “ Manhattan” is the middle syllable. “ Manhattan.”</p>
<p>Also, I hear that I’m not really pronouncing these T’s as True T’s. That would be “ Manhattan, -tan” . But I’m saying “ Manhatt-an” , with a little break. That means these T’s are stop T’s. “ In Manhattan.” [x2]</p>
<p>Also, the last syllable, “ -an, -an, -an” , is really just the N sound. So the letter A there is representing the schwa sound. “ Manhattan, Manhattan.” “ In Manhattan. [x3] Currently in midtown.”</p>
<p>Again, I did not hear the release of this T. That would be “ currently” , I heard “ currently” , with a stop, that’s a stop T. “ Currently, currently.” And, in this three-syllable word, I notice that stress is on the first syllable. “ Curr-, curr-, currently.”</p>
<p>“ Currently in midtown.” [x2] “ Midtown.” Stress on the first syllable here, and that is a true T. “ Midtown. Currently in midtown.”</p>
<p>“ Currently in midtown. [x3] But I do move around a lot.” The stressed syllables in that sentence are “ do” , “ round” , and “ lot” . “ But I do move around a lot.”</p>
<p>“ But I do move around a lot.” [x2] Let’s talk about the T pronunciations here.</p>
<p>“ But I do, but I, but I.” I’m hearing that as a flap T, or a D sound. “ But I, but I.” It’s also very connected. “ But I do, but I do.” “ But I do move around a lot.” [x2]</p>
<p>The final T, “ lot” , I did release that and give it a true T sound. “ But I do move around a lot.” [x3]</p>
<p>Again, this sentence was very linked together, the ending V consonant here linking onto the next vowel, “ move-a, move-a, va, va, va, move around. But I do move around a lot.” “ But I do move around a lot. [x3] I’ve been in New York for about five years.”</p>
<p>The stressed words in this sentence fragment: “ New” , “ York” , and “ Five” , “ Years” . “ I’ve been in New York for about five years.” [x2]</p>
<p>So how are the unstressed words pronounced? The contraction “ I’ve” , the word “ been” , and “ in” : they’re all quite quick and linked together. “ I’ve been in, I’ve been in, I’ve been in, I’ve been in, I’ve been in New York.”</p>
<p>And the words “ for” and “ about” : “ for about five years.” I notice I’m reducing this to the schwa, “ for, for, for about five years, for about five years. I’ve been in New York for about five years.” So, these three words, “ I’ve been in” , very quick. They’re unstressed.</p>
<p>“ New” , “ York” : the pace slows down a bit there, so those words are longer because they’re stressed. Then, “ for about” . Those two words, unstressed, are again quite quick. “ For about.”</p>
<p>And then “ five” and “ years” are both given more time because they are stressed. “ I’ve been in New York for about five years, [x3] and I’ve already moved four times.”</p>
<p>Here I’m hearing “ al-“ and “ moved” , “ four” and “ times” as being the most stressed syllables in that sentence fragment. “ And I’ve already moved four times.” “ And I’ve already moved four times.” [x2]</p>
<p>I also notice I’m not really pronouncing the L here. This syllable is coming out more like the AW as in LAW vowel, “ already, already.” “ And I’ve already moved four times.” [x2]</p>
<p>Also, did you notice how I reduced the word “ and” ? “ And I’ve already moved.” “ Nn, nn, nn, nn” , the schwa N sound. “ And I’ve already moved.” “ And I’ve already moved four times.” [x3]</p>
<p>So, just a few lines of speech, but there’s really a lot to study about reductions and stressed words, the way T is pronounced, and how words link together. I hope this has given you some ideas on how to take notes and study the speech of native speakers.</p>
<p>Do this on your own. Take video and audio clips that interest you, or that have topics that are important to your field of work. After you take good notes, record the text yourself, and compare to the original recording. What do you still need to work on, or what did you do well?</p>
<p>This is a great way to improve your pronunciation. That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

We may stay in the West Village afterwards, or we may hop on our bikes and go up to UCB for a comedy show.</h3><p>I call this a Ben Franklin exercise. This is when you take very good notes, very detailed notes, on what you’re hearing. And then go back and try to record yourself based on what you’ve written down, the notes.</p>
<p>Did you write down a Flap T, or the way two words link together? After you’ve recorded yourself, compare it to the original. Did you do everything that you wanted to do?</p>
<p>In this video, we’re going to take notes together. Tonight I’m meeting up with some friends in the West Village for pizza. We may stay in the West Village afterwards, or we may hop on our bikes and go up to UCB for a comedy show.</p>
<p>One of the first things that I notice is that I’ve made this a Stop T rather than a Flap T. “ Tonight I’m meeting up with some friends. Tonight.” [x3]</p>
<p>Often, when the T comes between vowels or diphthongs, in this case we have the AI as in BUY diphthong for “ tonight” , and the AI as in BUY diphthong for “ I” , we would make that a Flap T to connect. But I made this a stop T, so there was a little break in the line. “ Tonight I’m meeting, tonight, tonight.”</p>
<p>“ Tonight I’m meeting up with some friends. Tonight.” [x3] I also notice that I’ve made this O a schwa: “ to-, to-, to-, tonight.”</p>
<p>This T, on the other hand, was a Flap T, “ meeting up, meeting up.” I did not release the P here, so that’s a stop consonant. “ Up, Up.” My lips came together to make the P.</p>
<p>But rather than releasing them, “ up” , I went right into the next word, “ with” . “ Meeting up with some friends.” I’m noticing, sort of to my surprise, that I also dropped the TH. “ With some friends, with some friends.”</p>
<p>“ . . . up with some friends.” [x3] So, I took this function word, which will not be stressed (it is less important in the sentence) , and I dropped the final sound.</p>
<p>“ With some, with some, with some, with some friends in the West Village for pizza.” It’s very obvious to me there what the most stressed words are. “ In the West Village for pizza.” [x3]</p>
<p>Let’s start with the first four words: “ in the West Village.” “ In the” was very quick. “ In the.” [x6] “ West” and “ Village” both had more time. “ West, Village. In the West Village.”</p>
<p>So even though “ in the” is two words, it was probably faster than the single word “ West” . “ In the West, in the West Village.”</p>
<p>“ In the West Village.” [x3] And the final two words, “ for pizza. For pizza.”</p>
<p>I definitely hear the first syllable of “ pizza” as being stressed. The word “ for” was reduced, it had the schwa, “ for, [x4] for pizza, for pizza.” “ . . . for pizza. [x3] In the West Village for pizza.”</p>
<p>“ We may stay in the West Village afterwards” : which syllable was the most stressed? “ We may stay in the West Village afterwards.” [x3]</p>
<p>I definitely heard “ stay” as being the most stressed. That’s our verb. That’s a content word, which will usually be stressed in a sentence. Again “ in the” was very quick.</p>
<p>“ West” and “ Village” were both stressed, as was “ afterwards” , but they had less curve to the voice. They were less stressed to me than the word “ stay” , which was louder. “ We may stay in the West Village afterwards.”</p>
<p>I notice that I did not reduce the word “ or” . That’s one word that can reduce to “ er, er, er” : “ or we may, or we may” . But here I said “ or we may, or we may” . I did not reduce the vowel. “ Or we may hop on our bikes.” [x3]</p>
<p>“ We may hop on our bikes.” What do you think is the loudest, most stressed word in that sentence fragment? “ We may hop on our bikes.” [x3]</p>
<p>I hear “ hop” , again, the verb. “ We may hop on our bikes and go up to UCB.”</p>
<p>“ And go up to UCB.” I definitely reduced the word “ and” here, by dropping the D, “ and go up to UCB.” “ And go up.” [x3]</p>
<p>Again here, the word “ up” : I did not release the P sound, I made that a stop. “ Up to, up to.” Again, a reduction I did not do. The word “ to” usually has the schwa sound in it. And instead, I left in the vowel “ oo” . “ To, to.” I usually reduce the word “ to” in conversation.</p>
<p>“ To.” [x3] I did not do it here because I was talking into the camera, and I’ve noticed that I do use fewer reductions when I’m recording than I do in normal conversation. “ to UCB [x3] for a comedy show.”</p>
<p>“ For a comedy show.” I most definitely reduced this vowel to the schwa. “ For, [3x] for a, for a.” So I also connected that word, very much so, to the article “ a” , which is also pronounced as the schwa. “ For a. [4x] For a comedy show.”</p>
<p>“ for a, [3x] for a comedy show. For a comedy show.” Let’s test your listening skills for stress. The word “ comedy” is a three-syllable word. Which did you hear as being the most stressed?</p>
<p>“ comedy.” [x3] It’s the first syllable. So, the last two syllables are lower in pitch and flatter, also maybe a little quieter than the stressed syllable. “ -medy, [x4] co - medy. [x2] Comedy show.”</p>
<p>I hope this has given you some ideas on how to take notes and study the speech of native speakers. Do this on your own. Take video and audio clips that interest you, or that have topics that are important to your field of work.</p>
<p>After you take good notes, record the text yourself and compare to the original recording. What do you still need to work on, or what did you do well? This is a great way to improve your pronunciation.</p>
<p>Just a few lines of text, but there’s a lot to study about pronunciation. These were my plans for tonight. What are you plans tonight?</p>
<p>Let me know by making a video and posting it as a video response to this video on YouTube. I can’t wait to hear about your plans. That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

I’m leaving in 10 days. So it feels like there’s a lot to be done.”"></a>“ It’s a good long time. I’m leaving in 10 days. So it feels like there’s a lot to be done.”</h3><p>Here with my friend Tom, my favorite Rachel’s English teacher, besides myself. -Of course. We’re going to have a little conversation and then turn it into a Ben Franklin exercise.</p>
<p>. . . . . . “ Are you stressed about anything, Rach? Can I call you Rach? “ -“ You can call me Rach.”</p>
<p>“ Um, sort, of, but in a very good way. You know I’m leaving for Europe.” “ Yes, that’s right. How long are you going to be gone for? “ - “ I’m going to be gone for five weeks.”</p>
<p>“ That’s a good long time.” -“ It’s a good long time. I’m leaving in 10 days. So it feels like there’s a lot to be done.” “ Are you stressed about anything, Rach? “ [x2]</p>
<p>“ Are you stressed about anything, Rach? “ Every word there was quite fast except for the word “ you” . It’s a little uncommon to stress a function word like this. Normally, I think I would stress the word “ stressed” . “ Are you stressed about anything, Rach? “</p>
<p>But the reason why Tom stressed the word “ you” is because I had just asked him if he was stressed about anything. So now, he was turning the question to me, and he stressed “ you” . “ Are you stressed about anything, Rach? “</p>
<p>“ Are you stressed about anything, Rach? “ [x2] A couple other things I notice about this sentence, Tom turns the T into a D, making it a flap. “ About anything, about anything.”</p>
<p>He’s doing this because it’s a T coming between two vowel sounds. Even though it’s two separate words, the T still comes between two vowel sounds, which means it’s a great opportunity to link the two words together with a Flap T (which sounds like the American D).</p>
<p>“ About anything. [x3] Are you stressed about anything, Rach? “ “ Are you stressed about anything, Rach? “ [x2]</p>
<p>Did you notice how the intonation went up at the end? “ About anything Rach? Rach? Rach? “ That’s because this is a yes/no question. And yes/no questions go up in pitch at the end.</p>
<p>“ Are you stressed about anything, Rach? Can I call you Rach? “ -“ You can call me Rach.” “ Can I call you Rach? “ -“ You can call me Rach.”</p>
<p>These next two sentences are great examples of reducing the word “ can” . “ Can I call you Rach? “ -“ You can call me Rach.”</p>
<p>The word “ can” is so fast there, as if it has no vowels at all. Just the K sound and the N sound. “ Kn, kn, kn. Can I call you Rach? You can call me Rach.” “ Can I call you Rach? “ -“ You can call me Rach.” [x2]</p>
<p>Notice how everything flows together. We don’t feel like we have five separate words in this sentence. “ Can I call you Rach? Can I call you Rach? “ It’s just like one long word.</p>
<p>We do that by linking words together. When a word begins with a vowel, and the word before ends in a consonant, this is an easy time to link. Just like up here, when we used a Flap T to link. “ Can I.” [x3]</p>
<p>Linking an ending consonant to a beginning vowel helps smooth out the line. “ Can I. Can I call you Rach? You can call me Rach.” Again, the word “ can” is almost lost here. “ Kn, kn. You can call me Rach.”</p>
<p>“ Can I call you Rach? “ -“ You can call me Rach.” [x2] We reduce the word “ can” like this when it’s not the only verb in the sentence.</p>
<p>In these two sentences, the main verb is “ call” . That means the word “ can” is a helping verb. That’s a function word, it’s not as important as the main verb “ call” . The word “ can” is usually a helping verb. When you pronounce it reduced, “ kn, kn” , it will help you sound more American. “ Can I call you Rach? You can call me Rach. Kn, kn.”</p>
<p>“ Can I call you Rach? “ -“ You can call me Rach.” “ Um, sort of, but in a very good way.”</p>
<p>Did you notice? Another Flap T here, linking the word “ sort” and “ of” . “ Sort of, sort of, sort of.” So it sounded like an American D. I just said that when the T comes between two vowel sounds, it turns into a Flap T and can link words. But R is not a vowel sound.</p>
<p>The rule is, if the T comes between two vowels, or after an R, before a vowel, that it becomes a Flap T. “ Sort of.” [x3] If we think of this as one word, stress is on the first syllable. “ Sor-duv.” And the second syllable is very fast. It has the schwa, not a full vowel. “ Sort of.” [x2]</p>
<p>“ Um, sort of, but in a very good way.” Let’s go back for a second. I left something important out. The word “ um” .</p>
<p>This is the word we use when we’re thinking. “ Um” or “ uh” . These thinking sounds use the UH as in BUTTER vowel. “ Uh, uh.” I call this the core sound of American English. Everything in the mouth, face, neck, throat is extremely relaxed.</p>
<p>“ Uh, um.” That allows the placement to be lower in the body, less in the face. Very American. “ Um, uh.” “ Um, sort of, but in a very good way.” [x2]</p>
<p>The first syllable of the word “ very, ver-“ , and the word “ way, but in a very good way” , are the most stressed. Do you hear how fast this string of function words is? “ But in a. [x4] But in a very good way.” They all link together.</p>
<p>Again, we have ending consonant linking into a beginning vowel, ending consonant linking into a beginning vowel. Both of these links help to make it sound like one word, very smooth. “ But in a, but in a.”</p>
<p>Again, this T is turning into a Flap T, or, a D sound. “ But in a, but in a. But in a very good way.” “ Um, sort of, but in a very good way. You know I’m leaving for Europe.”</p>
<p>“ You know I’m leaving for Europe.” What do you hear as the most stressed syllables in this sentence? I hear “ know” , “ leav-“ , “ Eur-“ . “ You know I’m leaving for Europe.” “ You know I’m leaving for Europe.” [x2]</p>
<p>These are all the most important parts of the sentence, the content words. Content words are nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Here we have verb, verb, and proper noun.</p>
<p>“ You know I’m leaving for Europe.” Notice that in a content word, for example, “ leaving” , that only the stressed syllable is stressed. Even though this is an important word, and it’s a stressed word in the sentence, the unstressed syllable, the –ing ending, is not stressed.</p>
<p>So, unstressed syllables, even in stressed words, are still unstressed syllables. “ You know I’m leaving for Europe.” [x2]</p>
<p>Notice I use the contraction “ I’m” . Some of my students don’t like to use contractions because they don’t think they’re clear enough. They will say “ I am” .</p>
<p>“ You know I’m leaving for Europe.” But using a contraction, like “ I’m” , is just like up here, where we took these three words and linked them together and made them very fast. “ But in a.” So, contractions are words we reduce and link together in writing and in speech. “ I’m, I’m.”</p>
<p>“ You know I’m leaving for Europe.” [x2] Reducing and contracting words will help you sound very American.</p>
<p>There’s actually one more example of a reduction in this sentence. It’s the word “ for” . “ For Europe. For Europe.” I reduced that vowel to the schwa. And the schwa-R together make one sound, “ rr, rr, rr, fr, fr, fr. For Europe, for Europe.”</p>
<p>And again, here we have an ending consonant linking into a beginning vowel. “ For Europe.” [x3] So those two words glide together very easily. “ For Europe, for Europe.”</p>
<p>“ You know I’m leaving for Europe.” -“ Yes, that’s right. How long are you going to be gone for? “ This was all very fast. “ Yes, that’s right. How long are you going to be gone for? “</p>
<p>Wow. Tom didn’t even really finish the word “ right” . “ Yes that’s right how long? “ He certainly didn’t pronounce a full T. He moved on to the next sentence before he even finished that word.</p>
<p>“ Yes, that’s right. How long are you going to be gone for? “ So there was no real break here between sentences.</p>
<p>You probably noticed he took “ going to” and turned it into “ gonna” . “ How long are you gonna? You gonna? [x3] How long are you gonna be gone for? “</p>
<p>“ Yes, that’s right. How long are you going to be gone for? “ [x2] Did you notice Tom did not reduce the word “ for” to the schwa.</p>
<p>Well, I just said that that’s something that we want to do with this word in order to make it sound more American. But, I do need to add: we don’t reduce words like “ for” when they’re at the end of a sentence.</p>
<p>“ Yes, that’s right. How long are you going to be gone for? “ There, they need to be fully pronounced. Even though it was still very fast, it wasn’t a stressed word, it did have the full vowel.</p>
<p>“ Yes, that’s right. How long are you going to be gone for? “ -“ I’m going to be gone for five weeks.” [x2] “ I’m going to be gone for five weeks.”</p>
<p>Again, I used “ I’m” instead of “ I am” . That helped me make it fast and less important, compared to the more important words in the sentence. “ I’m going to be gone for five weeks.” [x2]</p>
<p>You also may have noticed, I also took “ going to” and pronounced it “ gonna” . “ I’m gonna.” [x3]</p>
<p>“ I’m going to be gone for five weeks.” [x2] How do you hear this word “ for” ? Listen again.</p>
<p>“ I’m going to be gone for five weeks.” [x2] You’re right, it’s reduced. “ For, for, for, for five, for five. For five weeks.”</p>
<p>“ I’m going to be gone for five weeks.” [x2] So, the most important words there, the loudest, the clearest, are “ gone” , “ five” , and “ weeks” . Those are the words that carry the actual meaning of the sentence.</p>
<p>So, we don’t reduce these more important words. But if we say all the other words fast, reduce them, then it makes these more important words stand out the most. “ I’m going to be gone for five weeks.”</p>
<p>“ I’m going to be gone for five weeks.” -“ That’s a good long time.” “ That’s a good long time.” Tom didn’t really pronounce the TH here. He reduced the word “ that’s” to just the schwa-TS sound. “ Utsa, utsa, utsa good long time.” [x2]</p>
<p>“ I’m going to be gone for five weeks.” -“ That’s a good long time.” [x2] We reduce “ that’s, it’s, what’s” , at the beginning of a sentence like this a lot.</p>
<p>And look, we have an ending consonant beginning vowel to link. “ That’s a” , [3x] that’s a good long time.” He stressed the last three words. “ I’m going to be gone for five weeks.” -“ That’s a good long time.” [x2]</p>
<p>We have adjective, adjective, noun. The three content words are stressed, longer, clearer.</p>
<p>“ I’m going to be gone for five weeks.” -“ That’s a good long time.” -“ It’s a good long time. I’m leaving in ten days.” I reduced the word “ it’s” by dropping the vowel. “ Tsa, tsa, it’s a good long time.”</p>
<p>“ It’s a good long time. I’m leaving in ten days.” “ It’s a good long time.” Linking the TS cluster into the schwa. “ Tsa, tsa, it’s a good long time. It’s a good long time.”</p>
<p>Again, these three words are stressed, “ good long time” . I stressed the word “ good” the most. “ It’s a good long time. It’s a good long time.”</p>
<p>Just like Tom did earlier, I didn’t really leave a sentence break here, did I? I went straight on to my next thought. “ It’s a good long time. I’m leaving in ten days.”</p>
<p>Look. Another contraction. The most important syllables in that sentence: “ leav-, ten, days.” “ I’m leaving in ten days.” [x4]</p>
<p>Again, they’re the most important parts of the sentence for content. The verb “ leaving” , and the time amount, “ ten days” . “ I’m leaving in ten days, so it feels like there’s a lot to be done.”</p>
<p>I notice the word “ it” is not very clear. “ So it feels.” [x2] “ I’m leaving in ten days, so it feels like there’s a lot to be done.”</p>
<p>“ So it feels like.” The word “ it” begins with a vowel. Here, the word before ends with a vowel. So we can link vowel to vowel. “ So it. [x3] So it feels like.” It’s a very smooth transition. And it can feel like I go through the glide consonant W. “ So it.” [x3] That helps me link them together. “ So it feels like.”</p>
<p>What’s happening with the T in “ it” ? It’s a Stop T. “ So it, so it, so it feels.” “ So it feels like.” The T is not fully pronounced, “ tt. So it, so it.”</p>
<p>But instead, I stop the air. “ So it.” In general, we pronounce T’s this way when the next sound is a consonant. “ So it feels like there’s a lot to be done.” And the ending Z sound of “ there’s” links right into the schwa sound uh. “ There’s a, there’s a, there’s a lot to be done.”</p>
<p>“ There’s a lot to be done.” [x2] How are these two words pronounced? “ Lot to, lot to.”</p>
<p>This is clearly not an “ oo” vowel, it’s a schwa. “ Lot to.” But what about the T’s? “ Lot to.” I’m making the first T a Stop T. “ Lot.” So I’m just stopping the air for a second—“ lot to, lot to” —before releasing to make the second T. “ There’s a lot to be done.”</p>
<p>“ There’s a lot to be done.” [x2] We use these three words together, “ a lot to” , quite a bit.</p>
<p>Let’s do a quick comparison to “ a lot of” , which we also use together frequently. Here we have an ending T consonant and beginning vowel.</p>
<p>The T comes between two vowels, so it’s a Flap T or a D sound. “ A lot of, a lot of.” So the T in “ lot” is pronounced one way in this phrase, “ a lot to” , and a different way in this phrase, “ a lot of” .</p>
<p>Let’s listen to the whole bit of conversation one more time. “ Are you stressed about anything, Rach? Can I call you Rach? “ -“ You can call me Rach.”</p>
<p>“ Um, sort, of, but in a very good way. You know I’m leaving for Europe.” “ Yes, that’s right. How long are you going to be gone for? “ -“ I’m going to be gone for five weeks.”</p>
<p>“ That’s a good long time.” -“ It’s a good long time. I’m leaving in 10 days. So it feels like there’s a lot to be done.” Even with just a little bit of speech, there’s a lot to study.</p>

So in this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to do a Ben Franklin exercise where we take real American English conversation and analyze the American accent to improve listening comprehension and pronunciation skills. . . . . . .</p>
<p>First, let’s listen to the whole conversation. R: HaQuyen, this is Tom. -HQ: Hi. -T: Hi. -HQ: Nice to meet you. -T: How are you? Nice to meet you, too.</p>
<p>R: Have you guys met before? -HQ: Um. . . T: I don’t think so. -HQ: No, not, not in person. But you’ve told me about him. -R: Okay. It seems like you have because I’ve known both of you for so long, but. . . -T: Yeah.</p>
<p>R: Never overlapped. -T: Yeah, well, it’s about time! Now for the analysis.</p>
<p>R: HaQuyen, this is Tom. Did you notice how the second syllable of “ HaQuyen” and the syllable “ Tom” were the most stressed?</p>
<p>They had that up-down shape. Especially “ Tom” , which came down in pitch at the end of the sentence. R: HaQuyen, this is Tom.</p>
<p>We want this shape in our stressed syllables. The two words “ this is” were flatter and quicker. R: HaQuyen, this is Tom. [x2] -HQ: Hi. -T: Hi.</p>
<p>Both words, “ hi, hi, hi” , had that up-down shape. “ Hi. Hi.” HQ: Hi. -T: Hi. [x3] -HQ: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>These two phrases happened at the same time. HaQuyen said, “ Nice to meet you.” What’s the most stressed word there? HQ: Nice to meet you. [x2]</p>
<p>“ Meet” . “ Nice” also had some stress, a little longer. “ Nice to meet you.” The word “ to” was reduced. Rather than the OO vowel, we have the schwa. “ Nice to, to, to.”</p>
<p>HQ: Nice to meet you. [x2] “ Nice to meet you.” What did you notice about the pronunciation of this T?</p>
<p>HQ: Nice to meet you. [x2] It was a Stop T. “ Meet you.” There was no release of the T sound.</p>
<p>HQ: Nice to meet you. [x2] Tom’s phrase, “ How are you? How are you? “</p>
<p>T: How are you? [2x] He stressed the word “ are” . “ How are you? “</p>
<p>T: How are you? [x2] You’ll also hear this with the word “ you” stressed. “ How are you? “</p>
<p>T: How are you? Nice to meet you, too. Tom really stressed the word “ too” .</p>
<p>T: Nice to meet you, too. [x2] It was the loudest and clearest of the sentence.</p>
<p>T: Nice to meet you, too. [2x] He, like HaQuyen, also reduced the word “ to” to the schwa. “ To, nice to, nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>T: Nice to meet you, too. [x2] Also, again like HaQuyen, he made a Stop T here. He did not release the T sound. “ Meet you.”</p>
<p>T: Nice to meet you, too. [x2] -R: Have you guys met before? I put a little break here, between “ guys” and “ met” , while I thought about what I was going to say.</p>
<p>R: Have you guys met before? Did you notice my pronunciation of T? A Stop T.</p>
<p>R: Met before? We tend to make T’s Stop T’s when the next word begins with a consonant.</p>
<p>Or, when the word is at the end of a thought or sentence. R: Met before? [x2] Have you guys met before?</p>
<p>What do you notice about the intonation of the sentence? How does it end? R: Have you guys met before?</p>
<p>“ Before? “ It goes up in pitch. R: Have you guys met before?</p>
<p>That’s because this is a yes/no question. A question that can be answered with yes or no goes up in pitch at the end. Other questions, and statements, go down in pitch.</p>
<p>T: I don’t think so. “ I don’t think so, I don’t think so.” Again, there was a clear stop in sound here. “ I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>T: I don’t thinks so. [x2] “ I don’t think so.” The words were not connected. “ I don’t, I don’t, I don’t think. I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“ Think” was the most stressed word there. “ I don’t think so.” Feel your energy go towards it and then away from it in the sentence. “ I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>T: I don’t think so. -HQ: No, not, not in person. The first “ not” was a Stop T, as HaQuyen did not continue. “ Not, not. Not in person.”</p>
<p>The second T, though, was a Flap T because it links two vowels together. The AH vowel, and the IH as in SIT vowel. Most Americans will make the T between vowels a Flap T, which sounds like a D between vowels. “ Not in [x3]. Not in person.”</p>
<p>HQ: Not in person. [x2] “ Person” is a two-syllable word. Which syllable is stressed?</p>
<p>HQ: Not in person. [x2] The first syllable. “ PER-son.”</p>
<p>The second syllable doesn’t really have a vowel in it. It’s the schwa sound. But when the schwa is followed by N, you don’t need to try to make a separate vowel, “ -son, -son, person, person.”</p>
<p>HQ: Not in person, [x2] but you’ve told me about him. How is the T pronounced in “ but” ?</p>
<p>HQ: But you’ve told me about him. [x2] It’s a Stop T, “ but you’ve, but you’ve” . What’s the most stressed, the most clear word in this phrase?</p>
<p>HQ: But you’ve told me about him. [x2] It’s the verb “ told” . “ But you’ve told me about him.” The sentence peaks with that word.</p>
<p>HQ: But you’ve told me about him. [x2] HaQuyen dropped the H in “ him” .</p>
<p>We do this often with the words “ him” , “ he” , “ his” , “ her” , for example. Also, “ have” and “ had” . HQ: But you’ve told me about him. [x2]</p>
<p>Now the T comes between two vowels. What’s that going to be? A Flap T. “ About him, about him.” Just flap the tongue on the roof of the mouth.</p>
<p>HQ: But you’ve told me about him. [x2] -R: Okay. I didn’t really pronounce the OH diphthong here, it was more like a schwa, “ okay, okay.”</p>
<p>“ -Kay” had the shape of a stressed syllable. “ Okay.” R: Okay. [x2] It seems like you have. . .</p>
<p>In the first part of this sentence, what is the most clear, the most stressed syllable? R: It seems like you have [x2]</p>
<p>It’s the word “ seems” . “ It seems like you have.” [x2] R: It seems like you have [x2] because I’ve known both of you for so long, but.</p>
<p>What about in the second half of the sentence. What’s the most stressed syllable? R: because I’ve known both of you for so long, but. [x2]</p>
<p>“ Known.” “ Because I’ve known both of you for so long.” “ Long” is also stressed, it’s also a longer word. R: because I’ve known both of you for so long, but. [x2]</p>
<p>Even though this sentence is very fast, it still has longer stressed words, “ seems” , “ known” , “ long” . It’s important to keep your stressed words longer, even when you’re speaking quickly. This is what’s clear to Americans.</p>
<p>R: because I’ve known both of you for so long, but. [x2] The less important words, the function words, will be less clear and very fast. And sometimes, we’ll change the sounds.</p>
<p>For example, in the word “ for” . That was pronounced with the schwa, “ for, for, for” . It’s very fast. R: For so long, [x2] but.</p>
<p>How did I pronounce the T in “ but” ? R: For so long, but. [x2]</p>
<p>It was the end of my thought, it was a Stop T. “ But, but.” I stopped the air. R: For so long, but. [x2] -T: Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom’s interjection, “ yeah” : stressed. Up-down shape. “ Yeah, yeah, yeah.” T: Yeah. [x2] -R: Never overlapped.</p>
<p>Can you tell which is the stressed syllable in “ never” ? Which is longer? R: Never overlapped. [x2]</p>
<p>It’s the first syllable. “ Ne-ver.” What about in the next word? R: Never overlapped. [x2]</p>
<p>Again, it’s the first syllable. “ O-verlapped. Never overlapped. Uh-uh. Never overlapped.” R: Never overlapped. [x2]</p>
<p>Notice the –ed ending here is pronounced as a T, an unvoiced sound. That’s because the sound before, P, was also unvoiced. “ Overlapped, overlapped.” R: Never overlapped. [x2] -T: Yeah, well, it’s about time.</p>
<p>Did you notice that Tom didn’t really make a vowel here. “ Tsabout, tsabout.” He connected the TS sound into the next sound. T: Well, it’s about time. [x2]</p>
<p>How is this T pronounced? T: Well, it’s about time. [x2]</p>
<p>A Stop T, because the next sound is a consonant. T: Well, it’s about time.</p>
<p>Let’s listen again, following along with our marked up text. You’ll hear two different speeds, regular pace, and slowed down.</p>
<p>R: HaQuyen, this is Tom. -HQ: Hi. -T: Hi. -HQ: Nice to meet you. -T: How are you? Nice to meet you, too. R: Have you guys met before? -HQ: Um. . .</p>
<p>T: I don’t think so. -HQ: No, not, not in person. But you’ve told me about him. -R: Okay. It seems like you have because I’ve known both of you for so long, but. . . -T: Yeah. R: Never overlapped. -T: Yeah, well, it’s about time!</p>
<p>. . . . . . R: HaQuyen, this is Tom. -HQ: Hi. -T: Hi. -HQ: Nice to meet you. -T: How are you? Nice to meet you, too.</p>
<p>R: Have you guys met before? -HQ: Um. . . T: I don’t think so. -HQ: No, not, not in person. But you’ve told me about him. -R: Okay. It seems like you have because I’ve known both of you for so long, but. . . -T: Yeah.</p>
<p>R: Never overlapped. -T: Yeah, well, it’s about time! We’ll listen one last time. This time, you’ll repeat.</p>
<p>You’ll hear each sentence or sentence fragment three times. Repeat exactly as you hear it, paying attention to intonation, sounds, and stress.</p>
<p>R: HaQuyen, this is Tom. [x3] HQ: Hi. -T: Hi. [x3]</p>
<p>HQ: Nice to meet you. -T: How are you? [x3] T: Nice to meet you, too. [x3]</p>
<p>R: Have you guys met before? [x3] HQ: Um. . . -T: I don’t think so. [x3]</p>
<p>HQ: No, not, not in person. [x3] But you’ve told me about him. [x3]</p>
<p>R: Okay. [x3] It seems like you have [x3]</p>
<p>because I’ve known both of you [x3] for so long, but. . . [x3]</p>
<p>T: Yeah. [x3] R: Never overlapped. [x3]</p>
<p>T: Yeah, well, it’s about time! [x3] Now the conversation, one more time.</p>
<p>R: HaQuyen, this is Tom. -HQ: Hi. -T: Hi. -HQ: Nice to meet you. -T: How are you? Nice to meet you, too. R: Have you guys met before? -HQ: Um. . .</p>
<p>T: I don’t think so. -HQ: No, not, not in person. But you’ve told me about him. -R: Okay. It seems like you have because I’ve known both of you for so long, but. . . -T: Yeah. R: Never overlapped. -T: Yeah, well, it’s about time!</p>

I think they want to just chat, and, you know. . . -Yeah. -Stuff before. -Sure. Will it take, like 15 minutes to get there, or? -Oh no. It’ll take. . . -Ten? -Five. -Five.</h3><p>In this American English pronunciation video, you’re going to come with me to my home state of Florida and we’re going to do a Ben Franklin exercise where we study conversation. Today’s topic: discussing plans.</p>
<p>. . . . . . Not till two. -Right, but we’re. . . -And maybe somewhat after that. -But we said we’d be there at 1:30.</p>
<p>Right. I think they want to just chat, and, you know. . . -Yeah. -Stuff before. -Sure. Will it take, like 15 minutes to get there, or? -Oh no. It’ll take. . . -Ten? -Five. -Five.</p>
<p>. . . . . . “ Not till two.”</p>
<p>I notice my dad makes a Stop T here, “ not till, not till” , instead of “ not till” . That makes the transition between these two words less obvious, it makes it a smoother link. “ Not till two.”</p>
<p>“ Not till two.” [x2] -“ Right, but we’re. . .” -“ And maybe somewhat after that.” Another Stop T here at the end of “ that” because it’s the end of a thought, the end of a sentence.</p>
<p>Often we make those T’s Stop T’s in American English. “ somewhat after that.” [x3] -“ But we said we’d be there at 1:30.”</p>
<p>“ But we.” I actually dropped the T altogether here to make this even more connected and smooth. “ But we, but we.” “ But” is a function word, not too important, so it’s okay to reduce it.</p>
<p>“ But we said we’d [x3] be there at 1:30.” Did you notice how I pronounced “ thirty” ? I took this second T and made it a Flap T so it sounded like a D. “ Thirty, thirty, 1:30.”</p>
<p>“ But we said we’d be there at 1:30.” [x3] This was another Stop T. And, it was very quick, so it was hard to tell, but I think this was a schwa, “ at, at. At 1:30.” [x2]</p>
<p>“ Be there at 1:30.” [x3] When you’re talking about the time of something, try pronouncing “ at” this way, very quickly.</p>
<p>“ Right. I think they want to just. . .” Another Stop T here. It’s the end of a sentence. “ Right.”</p>
<p>“ Right. [x3] I think they want to just.” Did you notice how my Dad did not make a TH sound here, but rather just an H sound? And he connected it to “ I” . “ I think, I think, I think.”</p>
<p>“ I think they want to just.” [x3] I’ve noticed some native speakers do this with the TH in “ think” . We use this phrase a lot. “ I think this, I think that.”</p>
<p>And it’s not uncommon to hear the H sound instead of the TH. It’s a funny little reduction that we do of a content word. “ I think they.” “ I think they want to just [x3] chat, and. . .” -“ Yeah.”</p>
<p>You probably noticed the “ wanna” reduction here. “ I think they want to.” [x3]</p>
<p>Very common in American English. “ I think they want to just chat, and. . .” -“ Yeah.”</p>
<p>Also, the word “ just” . We often reduce this so it sounds like there’s basically no vowel. “ Just [x3], want to just [x2].” “ I think they want to just [x3] chat, and. . .” -“ Yeah.”</p>
<p>“ Chat.” Another Stop T at the end of this thought. “ I think they want to just chat, and. . .”</p>
<p>The word “ and” was very reduced, to just the schwa-N sound, “ nn, nn.” “ Chat and.” -“ Yeah.” [x3]</p>
<p>“ You know, stuff.” “ You know.” Did you notice that this was the schwa and not the OO as in BOO vowel? “ You, you, you know.”</p>
<p>We pronounce these two words together this way all the time. “ You know.” [x3] “ Chat and.” -“ Yeah.”</p>
<p>“ You know, stuff [x3] before.” -“ Sure.” “ Will it take, like, fifteen minutes to get there, or? “</p>
<p>Let’s talk about the word “ fifteen” for a second. Some people have a hard time hearing the difference between 15 and 50.</p>
<p>The sounds are a little different, but also, the stress is different. “ Fifteen.” Stress is on the second syllable there, “ -teen, -teen, fifteen.”</p>
<p>So it’s short-long. For the word “ fifty” , it’s the opposite. It’s long-short. “ Fifty, fifty.” “ Fifteen, fifteen.”</p>
<p>“ Will it take, like fifteen minutes [x3] to get there, or? “ I reduced the vowel in “ to” to the schwa, like we almost always do. I did keep this as a True T though. The sound before was unvoiced, “ ts, ts, ts. Minutes to.” [x2]</p>
<p>“ Fifteen minutes to get there, or? “ [x3] Did you notice this T? Stop T because the next sound was a consonant, the voiced TH.</p>
<p>“ Get there, get there.” “ Fifteen minutes to get there, or? “ [x3]</p>
<p>How was this word pronounced? “ Or, or.” Just the schwa-R sound, very quick. This is another function word, so I’ve reduced it. “ To get there, or? “ [x3] -“ Oh no. It’ll take. . .”</p>
<p>Did you hear Dad? He reduced “ it will” to the contraction “ it’ll” . “ It’ll.” [x3] “ Oh no. It’ll take. . .” [x3] -“ Ten? “ -“ Five.” -“ Five.”</p>
<p>What’s different about the pitch, the intonation of these two phrases? “ Ten? “ -“ Five.” -“ Five.”</p>
<p>This one goes up in pitch, this one goes down. That’s because I’m asking the question here. I don’t know how long it will take.</p>
<p>The statement, where my dad was sure, goes down in pitch. If you’re not sure, your phrase goes up. If you’re sure, your phrase goes down.</p>
<p>“ Ten? “ -“ Five.” -“ Five.” [x3] Not till two. -Right, but we’re. . . -And maybe somewhat after that. -But we said we’d be there at 1:30.</p>
<p>Right. I think they want to just chat, and, you know. . . -Yeah. -Stuff before. -Sure. Will it take, like 15 minutes to get there? Or? -Oh no. It’ll take. . . -Ten? -Five. -Five. Okay. So we can leave at, like, 1:25. -Yeah.</p>
<p>We might as well head back anyway. -Yeah. That way we can still. . . -Yeah. -Stop and look at the alligators if we want. -Right. We probably won’t see much more. I was hoping to see. . . -No. -sandhill cranes, but. -Right. We would definitely see, we would definitely see more alligators, but we probably wouldn’t see anymore of anything different.</p>
<p>Well, we’ve seen enough of those I think. . . . . . .</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
<h2 id="10-美语发音-That的弱读技巧-American-English-Pronunciation-How-to-Reduce-“THAT”"><a href="#10-美语发音-That的弱读技巧-American-English-Pronunciation-How-to-Reduce-“THAT”" class="headerlink" title="10 美语发音 - That的弱读技巧 American English Pronunciation - How to Reduce “THAT”"></a>10 美语发音 - That的弱读技巧 American English Pronunciation - How to Reduce “THAT”</h2><p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to go over how to pronounce the word THAT in a sentence.</p>
<p>As you probably know, in American English, there are lots of words called function words that will be unstressed in a sentence. And some of these will reduce.</p>
<p>THAT is one of those words. In a sentence, the vowel will often reduce to the schwa sound.</p>
<p>The final T will be a stop T if the next word begins with a consonant, or it will be a flap T if the next word begins with a vowel or diphthong.</p>
<p>The voiced, TH, where the tongue tip comes just through the teeth.</p>
<p>Then for the schwa sound, the tongue tip pulls back and comes down, rests just behind the bottom front teeth, and the tongue is very relaxed.</p>
<p>For the T, flap or stop, the tongue tip will go to the roof of the mouth, and cut off the air flow for the stop T, or bounce back down, letting the air through for the flap T.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some sample sentence fragments.</p>
<p>“that my.” [x2] The next word here, my, begins with a consonant. So the T at the end of the word ‘that’ is a stop: that my.</p>
<p>“that I.” [x2] The next word here, I, has the AI diphthong. So, the T at the end of the word ‘that’ is a flap T. “that I.” [x2].</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at some full sentences.</p>
<p>The movie that I saw was boring. “that I.” [x2] Again, the AI diphthong, so the T is a flap. That I. The movie that I saw was boring.</p>
<p>We thought that we could be there. “that we.” [x2] So, the word ‘we’, beginning with the W consonant, the T is a stop T. “that we.” [x2] We thought that we could be there.</p>
<p>I know that you’re disappointed. “that you’re.” [x2] So, the next word here begins with the Y consonant, so the T is a stop T. “that” [x2], “that you’re.” [x2]. I know that you’re disappointed.</p>
<p>I read that her team won. “that her.” [x2] Here, with the word ‘her’, I’m dropping the H. So, the sound after the T, is the schwa sound, a vowel. Therefore, it’s a flap T. “that her.” [x2] I heard that her team won.</p>
<p>Will the word ‘that’ always be pronounced this way in a sentence? No. Sometimes it will have the AA vowel.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to stress the word: It was easy. It wasn’t that easy.</p>
<p>Thaa, aa. There, I’m keeping the AA vowel. Also, in this sentence, the word ‘that’ is an adverb. And adverbs are generally content words, not going to reduce in a sentence.</p>
<p>But you will often hear the word ‘that’ reduced. Doing it yourself will help to smooth out your speech, and will also provide some nice rhythmic contrast to the longer, stressed syllables in a sentence.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

<p>I’ve spent quite a bit of time in my videos talking about reduction and linking.</p>
<p>And today, I want to take this specific case of linking the words ‘to’ and ‘the’, and talk about how to simplify the mouth movement when we’re reducing these words, linking them, and making them very, very fast.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to point out, is that there doesn’t have to be any movement in the lips or the jaw: we can articulate this with just the tongue. To the. [x7]</p>
<p>So, what are we doing here?</p>
<p>The word ‘to’ will reduce to either the true T-schwa sound, or the flap T-schwa sound. But for both of them, the tongue position will be the same.</p>
<p>So the tongue tip is up at the roof of the mouth, ttt, with the jaw quite closed and the teeth pretty much together: tt, dd, tt, dd.</p>
<p>And I can make that sound just by moving the tongue, the jaw doesn’t have to move: t, d, t, d.</p>
<p>Now, to make the TH for the word ‘the’. I do not need to bring the tongue all the way through the teeth.</p>
<p>I can just bring it down, so it’s touching just behind, where the teeth come together. To, the [x3]. To the [x7].</p>
<p>Let’s look at this up close and in slow motion. To the [x9].</p>
<p>The word T-H-E is pronounced with the EE vowel when the next word begins with a vowel or diphthong.</p>
<p>For example, to the other side, to the east. In these cases as well, all the articulation will happen with the tongue.</p>
<p>It will probably take a good bit of time and drilling to get this new way of saying ‘to the’ into your habit. But it is worth doing.</p>
<p>Because when we simplify the mouth movement, it means it’s going to be easier to say it quickly in speech.</p>
<p>And when we reduce and pronounce these unstressed words very quickly like this, it provides a nice contrast for the stressed words, which are much longer, and have a lot more shape.</p>
<p>As you drill these two words, put them into sentence fragments, and eventually sentences. To the [x3]. To the store [x3].</p>
<p>To the restaurant [x3]. I’m going to the restaurant [x2]. It will really help you to integrate that into your everyday speech.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

It’s a function word, and often not given much time in a sentence. In fact, sometimes it’s reduced simply to the NN sound, like in this sentence.</p>
<p>And I’m going to have my friends there, and we’re going to relax and enjoy and have a good time. [x2]</p>
<p>So in this video, we’ll focus on the word ‘and’.</p>
<p>The word ‘and’ is a conjunction, and conjunctions are function words.</p>
<p>This means it will generally be unstressed in a sentence, and sometimes even reduced.</p>
<p>If you just say the word ‘and’ on its own, it is pronounced with the ‘aa’ as in ‘bat’ vowel, the N consonant sound, and the D consonant. And.</p>
<p>Now, when this ‘aa’ vowel is followed by a nasal consonant (that would be N, M, or NG) , the vowel sound does change a little bit. There’s an ‘uh’ kind of sound that happens between the vowel and the consonant. Aa-uh-nnd. And. [x2]</p>
<p>So the word, on its own, and. But, let’s check out the word ‘and’ in real conversation.</p>
<p>And I’d like a side of bacon. And I’d like a side of bacon. Did you notice how I didn’t pronounce the D in the word ‘and’?</p>
<p>Let’s listen again. And I’d like a side of bacon. An’I’d [x2].</p>
<p>It’s really important with function words, especially when we reduce something, that we link them to the words that come around them. An’I’d [x2], an’I’d like.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another example. And then my bacon is nice and thick. Nice n’ thick.</p>
<p>Did you notice how here I not only dropped the D, but I dropped the vowel sound altogether? Nn [x2]. Pretty much just the N consonant sound tying those two words together.</p>
<p>Let’s look again. And then my bacon is nice and thick. The word ‘and’ can reduce to ‘an’, or nn, also the schwa-N sound, uhn, as in this example.</p>
<p>He puts that on and then he puts this on. [x2]</p>
<p>So, the word ‘and’ in everyday conversation will probably reduce to ‘an’ or simply nn. And it will link to the words around it.</p>
<p>Because it is unstressed, it will also be low in pitch and said very quickly. Saying ‘and’ this way will smooth out speech and make it sound more natural.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some more examples. My mom and I will be there. My mom’n, my mom’n, my mom’n I, mom’n I, My mom and I will be there.</p>
<p>I’m taking off Monday and Tuesday. Monday’n, Monday’n, Monday and Tuesday. I’m taking off Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>I’ll take this one and that one. This one’n, this one’n, I’ll take this one and that one.</p>
<p>And now it’s over. An’now, an’, and now it’s over.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English. An’thanks, an’thanks.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>

<p>This video is sponsored by italki, where you can find a customized learning experience. More information at the end of the video.</p>
<p>Many words in English reduce in sentences. WAS and AS are two examples of this.</p>
<p>When a word reduces, that means a sound is changed or dropped.</p>
<p>As. By itself, the word is pronounced with the AA as in BAT vowel and the Z sound. As.</p>
<p>Most of the time, in a sentence, we reduce the vowel to the schwa: uhz. As, uhz.</p>
<p>Why do we do that? It doesn’t sound clear. That’s ok.</p>
<p>In American English we have established this as a reduction. Even if it’s really fast, a native speaker will pick up on it.</p>
<p>In fact, we want it to be really fast so that the stressed syllables, the longer syllables, pop out of the sentence even more, are even more clear.</p>
<p>It’s the contrast of long vs. short that’s important in American English, so make your short really short.</p>
<p>Reducing the vowel to the schwa makes it easier to say it quickly. As, uhz.</p>
<p>To make the schwa sound, the jaw doesn’t really need to drop, uhz, uhz. It’s just a quick, quick vowel before the Z sound.</p>
<p>To make the Z, the tongue tip is forward and down, zz, teeth are together, and buzz the vocal cords. Uhz. [x3]</p>
<p>Let’s practice with some sentences.</p>
<p>“As long as she says it’s ok, it’s ok with me.” As long as [x2]. Uhz [x3].</p>
<p>“It’s not as if I didn’t already know that.” As if [x2]. Uhz [x3]. As if.</p>
<p>“I’m not as tall as her.” As tall as [x2]. Uhz [x2].</p>
<p>WAS makes the same reduction. On its own it’s pronounced ‘was’, with the UH as in BUTTER vowel.</p>
<p>But in a sentence, we often reduce it to the schwa, making it very fast. Wuz [x2].</p>
<p>Just start with the lips in a rounded position to make the W consonant, wuz. The rest is just like ‘as’.</p>
<p>Let’s practice with some sentences.</p>
<p>“I was on the phone.” Wuz [x2]. Was on the phone.</p>
<p>“She was already gone.” Wuz [x2]. Was already.</p>
<p>“It was really good.” Wuz [x2].</p>
<p>“He was there.” Wuz [x2].</p>
<p>These words are not reduced all the time. I’m thinking of the movie Clueless where one of the characters says “AS IF! “</p>
<p>There will always be cases where native speakers will choose to stress and not reduce these words.</p>
<p>But most of the time, reduce, reduce, reduce.</p>
<p>If you work on integrating these reductions into your speech, they will help to smooth out your speech, help your words connect better, and give your speech greater contrast between important and less important words.</p>
<p>You’ll sound more natural, relaxed, and American.</p>

<h2 id="14-美语发音-At的弱读技巧-American-English-Pronunciation-How-To-Reduce-“At”"><a href="#14-美语发音-At的弱读技巧-American-English-Pronunciation-How-To-Reduce-“At”" class="headerlink" title="14 美语发音 - At的弱读技巧 American English Pronunciation - How To Reduce “At”"></a>14 美语发音 - At的弱读技巧 American English Pronunciation - How To Reduce “At”</h2><p>In this American English pronunciation video, we’re going to go over how to pronounce the word AT in a sentence. I love reductions.</p>
<p>As you probably know, there are lots of words in American English that will sound different in the context of a sentence then they do on their own. AT is one of these words. On its own, it has the AA as in BAT vowel and the true T. At. [x2]</p>
<p>But in a sentence, it will often reduce to the schwa vowel. The final T will either be a stop T or a flap T depending on the next sound. If the next sound is a consonant, then it will be a stop T. If the next sound is a vowel or a diphthong, then it will be a flap T.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some sentence fragments. First, at my [x2]. The word after the word ‘at’ begins with the M consonant. So the T here is a stop T. At [x4], at my [x2].</p>
<p>At a [x2] The sound after the word ‘at’ here is the schwa sound, a vowel. So the ending T will be a flap T. At a [x4]. Now let’s look at some full sentences.</p>
<p>I’ll be at school. At [x2], the word after the word ‘at’ here is ‘school’, beginning with a consonant, so the T will be a stop T. At school [x2]. I’ll be at school. Also, are you noticing how fast the word is?</p>
<p>As a function word, as a reduced word, it’s very fast: at [x3]. This provides nice rhythmic contrast in the sentence to the stressed syllables.</p>
<p>For example, at school [x3]. They’re both one syllable, but the word ‘at’, much quicker than the word ‘school’. At school. I’ll be at her house. The next word, after the word “at”, is the word “her”. But I’m dropping the H to reduce that word, so the next sound is actually the schwa sound.</p>
<p>That means the T will be a flap T. At her[x3]. I’ll be at her house. [x2] I got it at the corner store. At the [x2]. So the word after the word ‘at’ begins with a consonant, therefore the T is a stop T. At the [x2]. I got it at the corner store.</p>
<p>I’m going to be at Anna’s until 6. At Anna’s [x2]. The next word begins with a vowel sound, so the T is a flap T. At Anna’s. I’m going to be at Anna’s until 6. I’m busy at the moment. At the [x2]. Again, the next word, ‘the’, begins with a consonant, so it’s a stop T. At the[x2]. I’m busy at the moment.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll notice when native speakers do this and start doing it yourself. Integrating the reduced ‘at’ into your speech will help smooth out the line, and also add some nice rhythmic contrast to the longer, stressed syllables in a sentence.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
<h2 id="15-美语发音-Are的发音技巧-American-English-Pronunciation-How-To-Pronounce-“Are”"><a href="#15-美语发音-Are的发音技巧-American-English-Pronunciation-How-To-Pronounce-“Are”" class="headerlink" title="15 美语发音 - Are的发音技巧 American English Pronunciation - How To Pronounce “Are”"></a>15 美语发音 - Are的发音技巧 American English Pronunciation - How To Pronounce “Are”</h2><p>I’ve gotten a few questions recently about the word ‘are’. Specifically someone recently asked if they were hearing correctly “What you doing? “ instead of “What are you doing? “</p>
<p>That is not grammatically correct, and a native speaker would not say “What you doing? “ However, a native speaker may reduce the word ‘are’ so much that a non-native speaker would have problems hearing it.</p>
<p>The word ‘are’ can be reduced simply to the schwa R sound, er [x3]. So in this sentence, “What are you doing? “ you may very well hear whater [x2], whater you doing? [x2] with the “er” very low in pitch and very fast.</p>
<p>What are you doing? What are [x2], it sounds like the word ‘butter’. Butter, what are, what are you doing? Now that you know what you’re listening for, see if you can hear it in this sentence: What are you doing? [x3]</p>
<p>The word ‘are’ is often shortened in writing as well, as a contraction with ‘you’, ‘we’, or ‘they’. They’re, for example. But it doesn’t have to be written as a contraction for it to be pronounced with this short ‘er’ sound.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a few more sentences where the word ‘are’ can be reduced. My cousins are coming tomorrow. My cousins are [x2], My cousins are coming tomorrow. [x2]</p>
<p>The cookies are good. The cookies are, are, the cookies are good. Where are the girls? Now here the word before ends in the schwa R sound, er, where er the girls? I would explain it as a re-emphasizing of the er sound: Where er the girls?</p>
<p>But in fast speech, it actually all blends together. Where are the girls? [x2] So it sounds like the word R is being dropped. Where are the girls?</p>
<p>And someone else asked about the word ‘are’ and the word ‘were’ – about them sounding the same when they’re both reduced. The word ‘were’ will always have that W sound at the beginning, so there is a difference in the pronunciation of these words.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example sentence. The kids are there. The kids er, er, er, just the R sound, the kids are there.</p>
<p>The kids were there. The kids ww, ww, were, were, the kids were there. The second one has that W sound in it. The kids are there, the kids were there. [x2] Can you hear the difference?</p>
<p>Now that you know this concept of the reduced word ‘are’, try it out in your speech. And listen for it when you’re listening to native speakers.</p>
<p>That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.</p>
